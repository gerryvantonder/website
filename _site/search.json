    "text": "I was born in Bulawayo in 1955 in the then Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. After completing my primary school education at Henry Low in Bulawayo, I attended the neighbouring Hamilton High School, a boys-only establishment, where I remained until the start of Form IV. At this time my dad was transferred to Gwelo (now Gweru), where I successfully sat for my ‘O’, ‘M’ and ‘A’ level certificates of education at co-ed Thornhill High School. Leaving school at the end of 1974, I joined the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Intaf) in January 1975.\n\n\n\n\nI was stationed at Karoi, Urungwe District, as a Cadet District Officer. In broad terms, the work largely comprised the administration of virtually every aspect of the lives of the country’s rural-based tribespeople. A year later, I reported to Chikurubi in Salisbury (now Harare) as a member of the Internal Affairs National Service 4 (Intake 150) call-up, to undergo three months intensive basic military training. I was then posted to Sipolilo, where I was based at Fort Harrison on the Angwa River in the Zambezi Valley. In November 1976, I was transferred to Mount Darwin, where he served in that large station’s intelligence section.\nIn January 1977, I undertook the Ministry of Internal Affairs’ sponsored university degree programme, graduating from the University of Rhodesia at the end of 1979 with a Bachelor of Administration (Honours) Degree. During university vacations, I was stationed in Sipolilo and Gwelo. After graduating, I was posted to Mount Darwin as a District Officer, being the Returning Officer for Rushinga during the Zimbabwe independence elections in 1980, and working through the period of transition from our counterinsurgency war ceasefire and return of the ZANLA guerrillas to assembly points in the district.\nAt this time my British-born wife, Tracey, and I got married in Salisbury, and shortly thereafter I left the civil service. In 1984, I was head hunted by a fresh produce marketing cooperative in Harare, where I became managing director. Out of concern for the provision of tertiary educational and future career opportunities for our two children, Andries and Ashleigh, in 1999 we settled in the UK. Today they are both doctors: Andries a DPhil in Clinical Medicine from the University of Oxford, and Ashleigh in gynaecology and obstetrics.\nHere in the UK the seed was planted that would develop into my full-blown passion for military history.\nIn keeping with my proud Danish ancestry, I am using a Viking logo for the website, courtesy of Illustrator 21.",

    "text": "LT-GEN KEITH ROBERT COSTER SSAS, ICD, OBE: A Life in Uniform\n\n\n\n\nIn August 2015, the late former commander of the Rhodesian Army (1968–1972), Lt-Gen Keith Coster’s son, Steve, and daughter-in-law, Cindy, approached me, wanting to know if I would like to take custody of personal memoirs, photographs, letters, certificates, records and some items of uniform that had belonged to the general. It was their wish that the collection find a permanent home in a Rhodesian museum. Suffice to say, I very readily accepted their magnanimous offer. In return, I promised them that I would construct a fact file on the military life of the general, so that a permanent record could be established.\n\nThe full-colour, coil-bound, 265-page file mainly comprises information and photos that have never before seen the light of day, let alone be published. General Coster’s life in uniform, as I titled it, was, for me, a massive revelation. I have now fulfilled my promise to the family who, on receiving the fact file, as their endorsement, said:\nHi Gerry, I have just downloaded your magnificent work on my dad. You have truly done a remarkable job of compiling all that history and information. It’s amazing what you have unearthed, well over and above that we supplied you! It will take me some time to go thru and absorb all the detail, but I wanted to say a huge a thank you for your efforts on behalf of our family. It will remain a fantastic legacy of his life.\nI am sure his grandchildren, other relatives and friends will find the work fascinating, and will enjoy reading this detailed history of his life.\nWith grateful thanks, Steve Coster\nHi Gerry, A Huge Thank You for all the work you’ve put in and the magnificent tribute that you’ve put together – I know that Dad would have approved! I haven’t read much of it yet but it really is a wonderful memoir of Dad’s life. Thanks again for your huge effort and the many hours it took you to put it all together. Kind regards and keep safe, Cindy Coster\nIn 1938, Keith Coster went into uniformed service in South Africa and earned his wings. In 1942, he was shot down in North Africa, and spent the rest of the war incarcerated in various Italian and German prisoner of war camps, including the famous Stalag Luft III of Great Escape fame. At the end of the war, he transferred to the South African army, and from there, with the rank of major, left South Africa in 1955 to join the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland army, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, the King’s African Rifles, based in the then Nyasaland.\nWith the demise of the Federation in 1963, it was a natural progression for him to transfer to the Southern Rhodesian Army. In 1968, and with the rank of lieutenant-general, he was appointed general officer commanding of the Rhodesian Army, a post he held until his retirement in 1972. He then went back to South Africa, where he spent thirteen years serving as a ‘civilian officer’ in the top national security organs of that country, for which he was bestowed with South Africa’s highest award, the Star of South Africa.\nThe file is brim-full of his personal accounts: pilot training, encounters with German aircraft, being shot down and taken prisoner; his experiences as a POW; the Rhodesian Army, including papers on security; a brush with a Russian spy while working for South African state security; and much, much more.\nWhat an amazing military life, which I now wish to share as it is a vitally important part of Rhodesian military history. I have gone a private printing route, based on print-to-order. If you wish me to have a copy printed for you, please e-mail me on g.van-tonder@sky.com\nPublisher: ‎Gerry van Tonder (2017)\nPaperback:‎ 260 pages\n\n\n\n\nNorth of the Red Line: Recollections of the Border War by Members of the SADF and SWATF: 1966–1989\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, much has been written about individuals and the forces and their operations in what became commonly known as South Africa’s Border War, or Grens Oorlog, but never before has the human spirit of this 23-year-old conflict been so graphically and unashamedly captured and chronicled as in this book. Equally unique, was the exclusive use of social media to invite and encourage individuals to tell their personal stories, without apology or recrimination, and so provide an indelible oral history of the war. Over a period of three years, 21,000 of them spoke.\n\nAmongst others across the defence forces spectrum, national service ‘troopies’, permanent force officers, aviators, aircrew, medics, submariners and padres, used Facebook to openly relate their experiences and to bare their souls and inner feelings. The unthinkable and improbable then happened. Erstwhile antagonists also stepped up to the plate, placing their own personal first-hand experiences amongst those of their enemies of yesterday: Russians, Cubans, Angolans and members of SWAPO shared aspects and perspectives of their war, and in doing so, also facilitated the corroboration of incidents and events.\nPeople from all arms and units of the South African defence forces were either consulted or actually contributed, resulting in a landmark compilation of personal anecdotes from the Border War. The story is further enriched by the inclusion of a rich plethora of hitherto unseen ‘unofficial’ photographs of stolen memories in a war situation where the taking of any such photographs was strictly prohibited. Veterans unabashedly wear their hearts on their sleeves, speaking of the psychological impact of untold tragedy and grief; of bravery and unmitigated fear; of shenanigans and mischievous escapades to relieve the pressures of war; of miracles and fate; of camaraderie and the brotherhood of the human spirit.\nTheir journeys are filled with tears, laughter, immense danger, pranks, poignancy, love and sorrow, but above all, it is the story told by those who were there, and the legacy of that war that remains in countless lives.\nPublisher: ‎30 South Publishers (2016)\nPaperback: 568 pages\nISBN: 9781928211976\nAmazon 30 South\n\n\n\n\nOPERATION LIGHTHOUSE: Intaf in the Rhodesian Bush War 1972–1980\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1890 and throughout its history, the men of Internal Affairs were bound by an intense loyalty to each other, combined with a deep understanding of the tribal people in their charge. Their greatest strengths were individuality and self-reliance, strengths that were called upon to the fullest during the rebellions of 1896–97, and again in the conflict of the 1970s. With verbatim first-hand accounts and anecdotes from Intaf staff at all levels, this book chronicles Intaf’s rapid forced conversion in the 1970s from the original dedicated and efficient district civil administration, to a paramilitary force tasked with carrying out normal administrative functions in abnormal situations.\n\nDespite inadequate weaponry and insufficient training, Intaf was all too frequently the only armed presence. There were just not enough security forces to go around.\nAll elements of Intaf’s activities are melded in the book to give a picture of one of the least-known and least-understood aspects of Rhodesia’s war against the guerrilla insurgents: the role of Intaf. This book serves to set the record straight.\nIntaf’s first priority was to defend the tribesmen and maintain the administration. In this task Intaf should have been supported by the military forces which, in common with much of the hierarchy in Salisbury, did not understand Intaf’s true role. Eventually Intaf found itself operating in support of the military or, in the absence of the army, acting independently in a military role. Detailed sections on weaponry, vehicles, military training, mine warfare, counter-terrorism operations and the protected villages programmes reveal this transformation. Ultimately, Intaf’s role saw the creation of provincial counter-insurgency units especially trained to seek and destroy communist-trained insurgents.\nThis book is a tribute to the tenacity and loyalty of all who served in Intaf, and their wives and families; the National Servicemen, the Vedettes, Community Advisers, Field and ADF staff, the regular members. With very little acknowledgment, support or recognition, they gave everything to the enormous dangerous tasks they faced.\nAs the traditional, almost paternal, guardian and custodian of these people, all the staff of Intaf found themselves at the forefront of this conflict. A virtual identity crisis arose, as they desperately, and against increasingly difficult odds, struggled to maintain a semblance of civil administration on the one hand, whilst performing armed and uniformed defensive and openly combatant roles on the other. Included are full Honours and Awards, including citations, and a comprehensive Roll of Honour. Fifty-four colour and black and white plates provide a thorough pictorial history.\nIf you wish me to have a copy printed for you, please e-mail me on g.van-tonder@sky.com\nPublisher: ‎Gerry van Tonder (2017)\nPaperback and electronic: 512 pages\nISBN: 9781928211976\n\n\n\n\nRhodesian Combined Forces Roll of Honour 1966-1981\n\n\n\n\nThe intention of this publication is to honour all who lost their lives in action, or while on active service, with the Rhodesian Security Forces during the period 1966–1981. This publication represents the single most comprehensive Rhodesian Combined Forces Roll of Honour covering the so-called Bush War.\n\nMany people have researched the casualties of the Rhodesian Bush War and it is highly unlikely that a single researcher will ever compile a definitive list of all those who perished. Dr J.R.T. Wood produced the first Roll of Honour of the Rhodesian Combined Forces while many others, including Gerry van Tonder and Adrian Haggett, have used his roll as a base for expansion, correction and addition. What was astonishing during our research, was the absolutely enormous number of errors and inaccuracies I discovered in Richard Wood’s original roll, including a Bronze Cross of Rhodesia recipient who in fact was alive and well and living in Bulawayo!\nNames of our African comrades in arms were horribly mutilated, showing a gross misunderstanding by so many of the culture and tradition of Rhodesia’s black folk. There were countless entries where only a first name was given, eg Private Dick, or Corporal George, or Sergeant Thomas. What a travesty. These men all had family names, often using their mutupo or isibongo, chiShona and isiNdebele respectively for their totem as their ‘surnames’.\nThis publication represents a complete break away from the traditional roll of honour which I refer to as a telephone book: a cold list of numbers and names. Our objective was to personalise the now 2,500 entries of the roll of honour. A monumental task, often testing our own emotions as family members open up and relive the lives of loved ones killed during the Bush War. But for me, the tears dried and a deep sense of achievement followed, knowing we have bestowed the ultimate honour on our war dead. For Gerry van Tonder the project remains active. Since publication, Gerry has doubled the volume of data as fresh information continuously comes to hand.\nPublisher: ‎30 South Publishers (2011)\nHardback and paperback: 152 pages\nISBN: 9781920143756\nHelion 30 South\n\n\n\n\nRhodesia Native Regiment and Rhodesian African Rifles 1916-1981: Book of Remembrance\n\n\n\n\nOver the years since 1980 when Rhodesia became Zimbabwe, much has been written and recorded about the various regiments that served the country of Rhodesia from the early pioneers in the 1890s, right through to the day that these fine units marched off their respective parade grounds for the last time and into the august annals of history.\n\nMuch of this service for the older regiments, such as the Rhodesia Regiment, the British South Africa Police, the Rhodesia Native Regiment and the Rhodesian African Rifles, was as a contribution to the British Empire’s war efforts during the South African War,both World Wars, and other regional conflicts of the 1950s and 1960s. This Book of Remembrance, however, has been specifically compiled as a lasting tribute to the men of the Rhodesia Native Regiment (RNR) and its successor the Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR) who, during the proud and honourable life of these units, made the ultimate sacrifice. It is not a definitive history of these regiments, as this has been admirably done in books such as Masodja and Ragtime Soldiers, to mention just a couple.\nAccordingly, the book briefly looks at the history of each of the regiments and their battalions, with pictorial depictions of uniforms, badges, theatres of operation and colours. Chapters are also dedicated to those who received honours and awards for bravery and dedication to duty, with citations where it has been possible to source. Nominal rolls, some incomplete, of Commanding Officers, officers and senior non-commissioned officers add to the overall remembrance theme of the book. The main content is the various Rolls of Honour, covering all the major conflicts and areas of operation in which the two units saw active service. Differing from the standard cold lists of names and numbers, where possible, the rolls carry more information about causes of death and places of final burial, important aspects of personalising individual entries. The book will therefore itself be a memorial record for generations to come.\nThe Rhodesian African Rifles Association (UK) has made the decision to erect a memorial to the RNR and RAR at the National Memorial Arboretum near Alrewas in England, already the home to a fine memorial to the British South Africa Police. The NMA Trustees have approved, in principle, the proposed memorial, pictured below. In April 2012, a tree-planting ceremony was held on the grounds of the 150-acre NMA to commemorate these two regiments. A plaque next to the tree honours those of the RNR and RAR who served Crown and country.\nIn May 2012, Brig Dave Heppenstall, former commanding officer of 1st Battalion RAR, approached me to see if I would author a Book of Remembrance, which will not only primarily be used as an important fund-raiser for the NMA memorial, but will be deposited in the NMA Chapel as part of our sacred duty to those of the RNR and RAR who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country and for mankind. I accepted the honour and privilege to help preserve the memory of those brave men of the Rhodesia Native Regiment and Rhodesian African Rifles. Colour and B&W plates show the uniforms and insignia of the regiment over time, together with detailed operational maps and photos of the units on active service.\nPublisher: ‎30 South Publishers (2015)\nHardback: 88 pages\nISBN: 9781928211730\nAmazon 30 South\n\n\n\n\nThe Rhodesia Regiment: 1899-1981\n\n\n\n\nAs the 19th century and Queen Victoria’s long reign drew to a close, volunteer squadrons of the Rhodesia regiment, recruited by Colonel Baden-Powell, were positioned along the border with Bechuanaland, to defend Rhodesia against Boer aggression. In 1914 Rhodesians again rallied to the Crown with the formation of two battalions of the Rhodesia Regiment to counter the German presence in South West and East Africa. Shortly after, many volunteered to join the Allied forces on the Western Front.\n\nDuring the Second World War the indomitable combat prowess and leadership talents of Rhodesia Regiment volunteers were strongly evident in many theatres, including North Africa, Somaliland, the Middle East, Italy, the Adriatic, Western Europe and South East Asia.\nIn 1947 the Crown bestowed the ultimate accolade, with the title ‘Royal’ prefixed to the regiment. Through the 1950s and ’60s, the experiences of Rhodesians in successive areas of conflict—Malaya, Suez, Aden and Nyasaland—significantly enhanced aspects of Rhodesia’s territorial army, particularly with regard to counter-insurgency warfare. Conscription ensured combat-readiness for the growing number of battalions and independent companies established throughout the country, providing a solid basis for the regiment to play a vital role in countering the ZANLA/ZIPRA guerrilla insurgencies of the 1960s and ’70s.\nSuch is the 81-year-old story of a proud territorial unit, the Rhodesia Regiment, now written and preserved for posterity, encapsulating the memory of all those who served in the regiment as well as those who laid down their lives for their country, many in foreign lands. Coordinated by Hugh Bomford, this definitive history has, over a period of seven years, been compiled by a core group of dedicated people, with over 400 other contributors. On 5 August 2014, after Her Majesty had confirmed that she would personally like a copy of the book, a delivery was made by Gerry van Tonder in a visit to Buckingham Palace.\nPublisher: ‎30 Degrees South Publishers (2014)\nHardback: 618 pages\nISBN: 9781920143893\nRhodesian Services Association",

Almost immediately, nationalist insurgents started to cross into Rhodesia from Zambia to use military means to force the government into submission.\nRhodesia’s security forces commenced ‘border-control’ operations, successfully eliminating whole gangs of poorly equipped guerrillas or ‘terrorists’, the term used by the Rhodesians. Troop deployments and motorised patrols were conducted using standard, ‘soft- skinned’ vehicles such as the Land Rover, Bedford RL trucks and Ford International F250s. Where the terrain permitted, Ferret scout cars were employed.\nThen over Christmas 1972, events in the Centenary commercial farming area north- west of the capital Salisbury (now Harare) would permanently change the manner in which the Rhodesians prosecuted counter-insurgency operations throughout most of rural Rhodesia. Members of the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI) and ‘C’ Squadron, Special Air Service (SAS), responded to attacks on two farm homesteads, during which an RLI F250 detonated an anti-tank landmine planted by the guerrillas. One soldier died of his injuries two days later, while another lost both his legs.\nThe Rhodesian security forces were completely unprepared for this type of warfare. Landmines—predominantly the Soviet-made TM-46—together with RPG-7 anti-tank rocket grenades employed in ambushes, exposed the inadequacy of existing vehicles. In a short space of time, and while isolated through international economic sanctions, local private enterprise and the military addressed the need for a range of vehicles that would afford the occupants protection from both landmines and ambush fire. As the guerrilla war escalated to engulf vast tracts of the Rhodesian countryside, where most roads were untarred, specialist factories rolled out a veritable ‘menagerie’ of locally designed and constructed mine- and ambush-protected (MAP) vehicles: Rhino, Hyena, Leopard, Kudu, Cougar, Crocodile, Puma. Attention was turned to applying mine protection to the existing, standard configuration Land Rover body and chassis. This entailed affixing steel blast-deflector plates behind the front wheel arches as well as deflectors shielding the rear wheels. Industrial conveyor belting was fitted across part of the rear cab window to also absorb blast from a rear-wheel detonation. The cab was further protected by a framework of roll-bars, made up of 32mm steel water piping. This served to protect the occupants should the blast overturn the vehicle. Seatbelts were also fitted and the wearing thereof made compulsory. The key to affording maximum protection for small numbers of vehicle occupants was to provide an armour-plated and roll bar-encased capsule, carried above offset front and rear wheel assemblies. Considerable time and personal resources to the development of such a mine-protected vehicle, with hours spent examining the wrecks of vehicles which had detonated landmines. This resulted in 1974 in the ‘Leopard’, a custom-built, mine-protected monocoque—French for ‘single shell’—unit, which could carry five passengers. It was powered by a relatively inadequate Volkswagen engine and Type-2 VW Kombi gearbox and an external fuel tank set well to the rear.\nIn 1975, another commercial enterprise came up with their version of a Rhodesian landmine-protected vehicle by designing the ‘Kudu’; originally the ‘Ojay’. The main characteristic of this Land Rover or Nissan 4x4 chassis-mounted vehicle, was the zigzag or concertina bullet deflectors on the sides of the capsule; with a bit of fertile imagination, this also resembled the corkscrew shape of the horns of an African antelope, the kudu.\nAt this stage of the war, the Kudu became the only mass-produced mine-protected vehicle in Rhodesia. With a passenger capacity of five to eight in addition to the driver, the powerful Nissan motor often led to speed restrictions or governing of the Kudu. Many criticised the Kudu for being both top-heavy, and therefore unstable and awkward to drive, with limited driver vision through the relatively small bullet-proof windscreen. As with the Rhino, there was also a railway variant.\nWhilst the mainstay of military heavy vehicles and troop carriers was initially from the Bedford and Mercedes stables, almost all other paramilitary and government departments, including the BSAP, had a fleet of centrally maintained 7-ton Isuzu and Nissan trucks. The chasses of these vehicles became the base for the mine-protected and armour-plated (MAP) ‘Crocodile’ and ‘Puma’ troop carriers.\nUsing the Rodef-25 Unimog chassis, the Rhodesian security forces had no qualms about copying the design of the West German UR-416 developed by Rheinstahl Maschinenbau. Although not anti-landmine protected, the ‘Pig’ was a heavily armed fighting vehicle, favoured on cross-border raids on guerrilla rear bases. It was fitted with three pivot mounts for Belgian-made, 7.62 mm, FN MAG general-purpose machine guns. It could also be equipped with twin AN/M2 12.7mm anti-aircraft guns or modified Hispano 20mm cannon.\nTowards the end of hostilities, the Rhodesians put to use several captured Soviet- made BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers. Constructed on the chassis and transmission of a ZiS-151 utility truck, the vehicle had first entered service with a number of Warsaw Pact member states in 1950, becoming the mainstay of Soviet motorised rifle battalions.\n\n\n\n\nForgotten Airmen\n\nBritain at War February 2020\n\n\nFrom May 1940 to March 1954, the Royal Air Force (RAF) had a functional presence in the self-governing British colony in Africa, Southern Rhodesia. As part of the Empire Air Training Scheme, the Rhodesian Air Training Group (RATG) was activated for the training of RAF and Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR) pilot cadets, navigators, air observers and air gunners. Elementary flying instruction would be given on de Havilland DH.82 Tiger Moth trainers—shipped from Britain—by RAF instructors, with a large percentage of them RAFVR sergeants.\nThe training scheme was officially activated on 23 January 1940, at the established RAF Cranborne Air Station (formerly Hillside) in suburban Salisbury, with the establishment of No. 20 Service Flying Training School (SFTS). The instructors had at their disposal four serviceable Hawker Hart biplanes, an Audax (Hart variant) awaiting rebuilding, eight training aircraft (de Havilland Tiger Moths and others), one Tiger Moth undergoing repair and two Hornet Moths available for transport and training. The Communications Squadron had six de Havilland (DH) Dragon Rapides and three DH.85 Leopard Moth monoplanes.\nAlmost all of the trainees would come from Britain, with a small number accepted locally, and from the Hellenic, Royal Australian and South African air forces. Pupil pilots attended lectures on the theory of flight, aircraft engines and elementary navigation, and shown how to communicate in Morse code with a lamp. Solo flying would be introduced once a certain level of competence had been achieved, interspersed with in-flight instruction and night flying by instrument. The Elementary Flying Training School (EFTS) phase culminated in course examinations.\nSuccessful candidates were then posted either to the Post Initial Training Wing Pool or to an EFTS. About one third of those who did not pass—an average of 6 percent—were accepted into No. 24 Combined Air Observers School (CAOS) for air-gunner training. The remainder were given trade training to be absorbed into the RATG, or were repatriated to the UK or posted to the Middle East.\nEach EFTS intake comprised 320 pupils: 50 from Post Initial Training Wing (ITW) Pool and 270 directly from the ITW secondary course. The RATG set as a target 80 hours flying time at EFTS level per phase, and 160 hours at a Service Flying Training School (SFTS).\nBy 1941, the RATG programme had, at its disposal, 295 DH Tiger Moths at EFTS, 217 Airspeed Oxfords and 222 North American Harvards at SFTS, and 33 Airspeed Oxfords, 19 Fairey Battles and 19 Avro Ansons at CAOS. In addition, there was a DH.87 Hornet Moth, a DH.85 Leopard Moth, a DH Rapide, two Gloster Gauntlets, a Hawker Hart and a Percival Vega Gull, the latter for the communications squadron. Today, in Zimbabwe (formerly Southern Rhodesia), the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) maintains the graves of 446 trainees who lost their lives during the RATG programme. These cemeteries are in Harare (Salisbury), Bulawayo and Gweru (Gwelo). These fatalities were almost entirely due to air crashes and collisions. Of this number, 317 (71 per cent) were RAF and RAFVR personnel. Typical of wartime recruitment, 70 per cent of aircrew fatalities were aged 26 and under, with four only 18 years old.\n\n\n\n\nBattle of Elands River\n\nBritain at War May 2020\n\n\nBy August 1900, ten months after the outbreak of hostilities between British forces and those of the Transvaal and Orange Free State Boer republics in South Africa, Her Majesty’s troops were starting to gain the ascendency across the subcontinent in what became known as the Second Boer War.\nBy the end of May 1900, and after the military disaster at Spioen Kop, Lord Frederick Roberts had embarked on his great flank march to take Bloemfontein, capital of the Orange Free State. Ladysmith, Kimberley and Mafeking were relieved, and Pretoria and Johannesburg captured.\nHowever, in the north-west of the region there were no British troops. One of only a small handful of British officers in the area, the aging Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Carrington was placed on the staff of the South Africa Field Force and given command of the Rhodesian Field Force.\nRoberts now divided the Western Transvaal operational theatre into districts, with the sole objective of mopping up pockets of Boer resistance. The Marico District, including the towns of Mafeking, Zeerust, Lichtenburg and Rustenburg, was assigned to Colonel Baden- Powell, his force comprising 1,100 Rhodesian Volunteers and British South Africa Police (BSAP).\nWith pockets of die-hard ‘bitter einder’ commandos scattered throughout the region, especially in the Magaliesberg, Baden-Powell deployed two mobile columns to effectively search out and neutralise these Boer units. One of these columns, the northern one, was under Colonel Plumer, with a force of 500 mounted men of the Rhodesia Regiment, equipped with four guns of the Royal Canadian Artillery. A small reserve of 100 mounted men of the BSAP was split between the two columns. In addition to this, each of 200 dismounted troops from the Rhodesia and Protectorate Regiments were held at Mafeking and Zeerust.\nWith the objective of occupying Rustenburg, Plumer’s column move eastwards from Zeerust via Magatosnek in the rugged Magaliesberg. This extensive range of mountains provided a substantial barrier, but several passes, referred to locally as ‘neks,’ allowed access to columns of troops with field guns. En route, Plumer left a garrison of 100 men of the Southern Rhodesian Volunteers at the drift through the Elands River. Large supplies of provisions and ammunition destined for Rustenburg and brought up by waggon from Mafeking and Zeerust would be secured at this staging post. Baden-Powell in the meantime had moved closer to Pretoria, occupying the Zilikats and Commando neks to the west of the Transvaal capital. He left behind at Rustenburg a squadron of the Protectorate Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel C.O. Hore, but a few days later Hore was ordered to retreat down the road towards Zeerust and the staging post at Elands River, as reports were being received of a large force of Boers descending on the town.\nHore’s force, made up entirely of colonials, comprised 105 men of the New South Wales Bushmen, 141 3rd Queensland Mounted Infantry, 53 Mounted Infantry from other Australian states, 201 Rhodesian volunteers and BSAP troopers under Captain Sandy Butters, and 50 African drivers. Significantly outnumbered, surrounded by high kopjes and mountains, and with only one 2.5” 7-pounder gun and two maxims to supplement their small arms, the garrison dug in, hoisted the Union Jack, and prepared themselves to defend the accumulation of stores and ammunition for which they were responsible. On 4 August, the siege commenced as the first Boer artillery shell destroyed the camp telegraph. This was followed by barrage of artillery and rifle fire from the surrounding Boers, a force of 2,000.\nThe men of the Elands River garrison had had to endure almost two weeks of constant attack from the Boers, spending days in roughly hewn pits, suffering from the heat and thirst and the all-pervading reek of the rotting carcasses of dead animals. Four Rhodesian Regiment troops were killed, the volunteers lost two, and a further two BSAP troopers perished during the siege. The Australians lost seven, while seven native porters were also killed. There were fifty-eight wounded.\n\n\n\n\nTreasure Hunters: Mashona Rebellion 1896–7\n\nBritain at War April 2021\n\n\nIn his 1898 book, With the Mounted Infantry and the Mashonaland Field Force 1896, Lieutenant Colonel Edwin Alfred Hervey Alderson of The Queen’s Own (Royal West Kent Regiment), upon receiving deployment orders to Mashonaland to assist with quelling a local uprising in that territory, somewhat prophetically observed,\nApparently no one in Mashonaland had even dreamt it was possible that the Mashonas might rise. . . that the worm might turn did not seem to have occurred too them, and the saying, ‘You only want a sjambok [whip] and a box of matches to take any Mashona kraal,’ has become proverbial. The result of this excessive contempt for the worm was that, when he did turn, the whites, taken completely by surprise and totally unprepared, appear to have gone into an almost equally excessive state of alarm.\nIn mid-June 1896, in Mashonaland, a name given to a large tract of real estate south of the Zambezi River, in what would become part of the colony of Southern Rhodesia and later Zimbabwe, rampaging Shona-speaking tribesmen attacked isolated mines, farms and trading posts, brutally murdering all white men, women and children they could find. In the space of a week, 117 civilians had been slaughtered.\nNehanda Charwe Nyakasikana, generally known as Mbuya Nehanda, was a spirit medium of Nehanda, a powerful and revered female ancestral spirit. Idolised for her spiritual prowess, Mashona tribespeople in the Mazoe District, a short distance north of Salisbury, readily answered her call to rise up against the white settlers. She gave a guarantee that the enemy’s bullets would turn to water and prove harmless.\nInsurrection in the territory commenced earlier that year when the amaNdebele in the southwest around Bulawayo rose up against the white settlers. Notwithstanding the fact that the Mashona and amaNdebele were historical enemies, actions by the latter galvanised the Mashona to follow suit.\nAt the time, most of the white population was scattered everywhere: on gold mines and at trading stores. British Army contingents such as the 4th (Queen’s Own) Hussars combined with local volunteer units to establish centralised defensive forts and laagers, and to conduct widespread patrols to quell the rebellion.\n\n\n\n\nDeadly Efficient Mobile Warfare: Rhodesian SAS\n\nClassic Military Vehicle October 2021\n\n\nFrom 1941 to 1980, ‘C’ (Rhodesia) Squadron was an integral and highly esteemed member of the Special Air Service (SAS) family. Inspired by the rapid Long Range Desert Group’s (LRDG) vehicle-borne rescue of elements of the SAS, whose first mission into German-held territory ended in failure as a result of severe sandstorms, No. 8 (Guards) Commando officer David Sterling developed the extremely successful SAS operational tactic that centred on small, heavily armed and mobile strike units.\nDesignated B Squadron, Rhodesians from the Argylls, the Buffs, the Sherwood Foresters and Durham Light Infantry formed ‘S’ Patrol. A second patrol, ‘S2’ soon followed, the strength of each patrol being an officer and 15-18 other ranks. Each vehicle sported a Rhodesian place name on the side, for example S.1 Salisbury and S.10. Sabi. T he Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) Ford 30-cwt F30 of the patrols had to be specially adapted to cope with the very hot and sandy Western Desert conditions. Radiators were fitted with condensers and extra leaves added to spring suspensions. Doors, windscreens and hoods were removed, while mounts and fittings for guns, jerry cans, water containers, sand-channels and a radio were added. When fully loaded at the commencement of a mission, each truck carried almost two tons of water and provisions for three or four men for three weeks, and sufficient fuel for 1,100 miles.\nFrom July 1942, Willys jeeps began to be issued. These were generally fitted with a twin- and two single-mounted Vickers K .303 machine guns. With the defeat of Field Marshall Rommel’s Afrika Korps, both the LRDG and SAS commenced operations in the Mediterranean as part of the liberation of Greece and Italy from German forces: the former in the Dodecanese and the latter, 3rd Squadron, 2nd SAS Regiment, in Italy.\nIn 1950, as Communist Chinese insurgents in Malaya sought to seize control, around 120 suitable candidates were selected as the Southern Rhodesia Far East Volunteer Unit (SRFEVU), redesignated ‘C’ Squadron on arrival in Malaya. the unit was also equipped with Humber Scout cars for road patrols. The armoured vehicle was armed with a Bren light machine gun (LMG) with a 50- or 100-round drum magazine, and a searchlight calibrated to 300 yards. After Malaya and service in Aden, the squadron was disbanded, only to be resurrected in April 1961.\nFirst introduced into the SAS in 1955, the squadron received Series I Land Rovers called Sabres. These came with a 2-litre petrol engine, four-wheel drive and an 88-inch wheelbase. Forward-mounted twin .303 Bren guns provided the main firepower. There was a searchlight above the driver’s head. The Rhodesian Sabres were also fitted with smoke- grenade launchers in front of the radiator grill.\nFollowing Rhodesia’s unilateral declaration of independence from Britain in November 1965, during the country’s counter-insurgency war of the 1970s the Sabres, the squadron increasingly made us of heavily armed and mine-protected Sabres to launch clandestine cross-border raids into neighbouring countries to neutralise guerilla bases.\n\n\n\n\nPearson’s Holdouts: Siege of Eshowe Anglo-Zulu War\n\nBritain at War July 2022\n\n\nAs commander of one of the three self-contained columns constituting Lord Chelmsford’s invasion force into Zululand in January 1879, Colonel Charles Pearson diligently studied his commander’s instructions. Notwithstanding the ominous and very real possibility of having “the whole Zulu force” descend on his Eshowe garrison, the quintessential Victorian army officer’s response was unequivocal. And, perhaps blissfully so, Pearson was totally unaware of the unspeakable disaster that, five days earlier, had befallen his brothers-in-arms some 100 miles to the northwest at a hill the Zulus called Isandlwana.\nFor Pearson, withdrawal was simply not an option. His original orders had been to establish a fortified garrison at the remote Eshowe mission station in Zulu king Cetshwayo’s territory. It would be from this position that Chelmsford intended to launch the final battle against the king’s seat of power at Ulundi.\nPerceived criminal misdemeanours under British law by certain senior Zulu men would be the catalyst for Lord Chelmsford’s fateful, three-pronged invasion of Zululand on 12 January 1879. Chelmsford and his headquarters staff rode with the centre column, commanded by Crimean veteran Colonel Richard Glyn of the 24th Regiment, while Victoria Cross recipient, Colonel Evelyn Wood, 90th Regiment, led the left column. Colonel Charles Pearson, who had seen action at the siege and fall of Sebastopol, commanded the right column.\nEstablishing a forward camp on the Lower Tugela—Fort Pearson—to facilitate the river crossing and to provide a supply and logistics base, Pearson’s command was ferried across the river in a 30-foot pont hauled by oxen. Consolidating on the right bank, the column comprised over 400 men from six companies of the 2nd Battalion, 3rd ‘the Buffs’ Regiment; 160 from three companies of the 99th (Duke of Edinburgh’s Lanarkshire) Regiment; 138 Naval Brigade (Blue Jackets) men from HMS Active with two 7-pounders, one Gatling and a Hale rocket tube; 23 troops of the Royal Artillery with two 7-pounder muzzle-loading guns; 90 Royal Engineers; 115 locally raised mounted infantry; 117 Colonial troopers; 1,655 officers and men of the 2nd Regiment, Natal Native Contingent (NNC); and 60 of No. 2 Company, Natal Native Pioneers.\nNumerous engagements with Zulu impis dogged Pearson’s column as he fought his way to Eshowe. On 23 January, the day after the Isandlwana tragedy and the gallant defence of Rorke’s Drift, the column reached the old Norwegian mission station at Eshowe. Pearson set about creating a well- defended depot for this line of Chelmsford’s invasion of the Zulu kingdom. A reliable source of water was close enough to be defended from the fort, and to save on food, he sent back the mounted men of the NNC to the Lower Tugela base, retaining 1,200 British troops for whom he had 320 rounds per man in store.\nA week later a message arrived from Chelmsford,\nConsider all my instructions as cancelled, and act in whatever manner you think most desirable in the interests of the force under your command. Should you consider the garrison of Eshowe as too far advanced to be fed with safety, you can withdraw it. Hold, however, if possible the posts on the Zulu side of the Lower Tugela. You must be prepared to have the whole Zulu force down upon you. Do away with tents, and let the men take shelter under the waggons, which will then be in a position for defence, and hold so many more supplies.\nBut Pearson refused to withdraw, even as food and ammunition reached dangerously low levels. During this time, Pearson went on the offensive, sending out attack patrols. Finally, after a major battle at Gingindlovu, late on the afternoon of 3 April Chelmsford led elements of the relief force into Eshowe. During the 10 weeks’ blockade, 4 officer and 27 other ranks had died.\nAgainst all odds, Colonel Pearson had clung on to this isolated British military outpost, despite suggestions from Lord Chelmsford that he return to the Lower Tugela. Historians still ponder what the outcome may have been had Cetshwayo rescinded his orders not to attack British forts. Another Isandlwana? Rorke’s Drift? Regardless, the selfless actions of Pearson and the men of his column were brave and determined, and certainly beyond the call of duty.\nUpon entering Eshowe Chelmsford immediately came to the conclusion that the fort would, after all, not be retained. The intricate defences Pearson had laboriously constructed were dismantled and the fort evacuated. Four days later the Zulus put Eshowe to the torch, and on 4 July, Cetshwayo’s capital at Ulundi fell to British forces.\n\n\n\n\nIronclads Across the Veld\n\nClassic Military Vehicle August 2022\n\n\nAs long ago as 1847—and again in 1849—James Anderson, of Edinburgh, prepared and patented a series of plans, and further submitted a working model of his defensive rolling stock for the inspection of British engineers and artillery officers. The British Government, though, could not see its way clear to adopt the invention, so Anderson went abroad with his idea, with the result that these ‘ironclad trains’ were used in Europe on the field of battle for the first time in the Franco-Prussian War (1870).\nArmoured trains were used in South Africa for the first time during the Second Boer War when both sides first took full advantage of the troop train. Shortly before the fall of Pretoria in June 1900, two Long Tom artillery pieces were mounted on Boer train trucks by Swedish engineer Axel Helmfrid Uggla at the ZASM (South African Railway Company) workshops in Pretoria. The trucks were armoured with one-inch-thick steel plates, with sandbags stacked in front of it to provide added protection. Dispensing with the cumbersome firing platform, the gun’s traverse was limited to 30 degrees, but it simplified the transport of the heavy piece. This ‘gun truck’ was complimented with further trucks that housed the crew, and carried ammunition and other stores.\nThe Official History of the War in South Africa describes the “garrison” of an armoured train as composite. In addition to the infantry escort, it comprised Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers detachments, the latter made up of an NCO and six sappers, trained in rail repair work and in re-positioning derailed engines and trucks. In addition, there were two telegraph linesmen, one telegraph clerk, two engine drivers and two firemen. All the men of this detachment were armed.\nAll trains carried a special gun truck, equipped with a pedestal-mounted, quick-firing gun. There was also a machine gun at each end, arranged with a lateral sweep to allow arcs of fire to cross at either side of the train at a distance of between 50 to 80 yards. From front to rear, a typical armoured train was composed of an open, low-sided bogie wagon, loaded with railway stores pushed ahead of the train; an armoured bogie with Maxims and/or a one-pounder Pom-pom, and fitted with an armoured roof to protect its occupants from plunging fire, and manned by an infantry section; two or three armoured, four-wheeled vans which acted as ammunition stores, living quarters, a telegraph office and searchlight carriers; the locomotive itself, comprehensively armoured with sheet metal; a water tank, an armoured gun truck, usually mounting a 12-pounder, quick-firing gun; and another armoured bogie truck, complete with Maxims and a rifle section. The officer commanding the train had his headquarters in the telegraph van from where he was in communication with the other vehicles via an internal circuit.\nAt best, the armoured train was a useful defensive support weapon, employed in conjunction with the flying columns that conducted drives to corner and neutralise pockets of Boer resistance. Blockhouses, concentration camps and a scorched-earth policy, combined with military cordons and sweeps, would eventually force Boer capitulation. Kitchener was fully aware that the very restricted nature of train manoeuvrability would give the vulnerable armoured train limited capabilities as an offensive weapon.\nOn the British side, the Imperial Military Railways (in the Orange Free State and Transvaal), under engineer Sir Percy Girouard developed into a huge department, which dovetailed with a parallel civilian organisational infrastructure designed to facilitate efficient and safe troop movements. However, the shift in Boer tactics to guerrilla warfare significantly increased the vulnerability of rail transport in the open veld. Boer gangs employed the treinvernieller, the ingeniously manufactured train-wrecker mine devised by Scottish-born, “honorary Boer citizen”, Oliver ‘Jack’ Hindon. The saboteurs caused major disruption to the British-run Delagoa Bay railway line with this improvised mine.\nDuring the guerrilla phase of the conflict, armoured trains were helpless against the Boer train-wrecking tactics which immobilised the train in a kill zone. At best, the armour generally provided a protective position from which the British escort could prevent the Boer attackers from overrunning the train and capturing valuable stores and matériel.\n\n\n\n\nA War Life Saver\n\nClassic Military Vehicle February 2023\n\n\nIn their armed fight to overthrow the minority white Rhodesian government, late in 1972 Soviet- and Communist Chinese-sponsored insurgents added landmines to their hitherto very limited weaponry. Most rural roads throughout the country were unpaved; perfect for this indiscriminate type of warfare. The laying of landmines became the standard insurgent means of cutting road links, isolating military fortifications, terrorising people, and inflicting damage and casualties on the military and any civilian road users.\nThe TM-46 is a large, circular, metal-cased, Soviet anti-tank mine, with a 5.7kg TNT charge. It uses either a pressure or tilt-rod fuse, which is screwed into the top. Anti-tank mines with this type of fuse were capable of inflicting much more damage to armoured vehicles, when compared to a typical anti-personnel mine.\nIn the capital city Salisbury (now Harare), automotive engineer Ernest Konschel employed his mechanical skills to address the new deadly threat. Displaying comprehensive innovation and remarkable dedication and application, the revolutionary ‘Pookie’ armoured landmine-detecting vehicle rolled out in November 1976.\nBy 1974, Konschel and a local manufacturer had designed and produced a mine- resistant vehicle that incorporated innovative designs key to providing significantly improved safety for the driver and his passengers.\nDubbed the ‘Leopard’, it had a V-shaped, four-seat monocoque armoured capsule set some 500mm above the ground between the front and rear suspensions from a VW Kombi. There was no chassis to trap a landmine blast. Also, without wheels under the vehicle, the explosion would blow away the wheel assembly without causing any damage to the passenger capsule. The employment of shear bolts aided this process. The fuel tank was sited with the engine at the rear and designed to be blown clear also. The centre of gravity enabled the Leopard to remain upright but, if it did not, it had circular roll bars.\nIn the next six years, 800 Leopards were built, of which 67 detonated landmines with only one fatality. Despite this remarkable success, however, unaffordable costs of repair as a result of landmine detonations remained. As a consequence, the priority now switched to clearing landmines. Milton mine-detecting pans were sourced from South Africa and tested on existing military vehicles, such as the Bedford RL, but excessive vibration negated such an application. More importantly, the weight of any available vehicle, including the Leopard, would still detonate a landmine.\nThe solution came in the unlikely form of Formula One racing slicks: completely smooth tyres with no grooves, readily available as discarded tyres from the Kyalami Circuit in South Africa. Exerting light ground pressure, these wide low-pressure tyres would be tested on a monocoque single-seat vehicle built on the lines of the Leopard, and powered by a rear-mounted 1600cc VW Kombi engine\nThe outcome was the ‘Pookie’, the local nickname for a galago, or bush baby, a small, furry, nocturnal African primate with very large eyes. Fitted with these low-pressure tyres, the Pookie, weighing just under two tons fully loaded, had a ground pressure of only 0.21 kg/cm, less than a human foot. In fact, it did not even activate anti-personnel mines, making it a perfect vehicle for mine detection. It was a seminal moment when Konschel and his colleagues looked on during trials to see how the F-1 tyres gently enveloped a surface-laid Soviet landmine without triggering the igniter.\nThe capsule, with a 55° ‘V’ shape made of 6–10mm steel plate, was lifted 70cm off the ground to reduce the destructive impact of a Soviet-made landmine. The windscreen and the side and rear windows were made of 40mm-thick bulletproof glass. There was no permanent roof to the compact cab, and was the driver’s entry point.Protruding from the left side of the capsule, was a compartment housing a lithium battery connected to the starter on the outside, the mine detector, the headlights and the dashboard on the left side of the steering wheel.\nCapable of finding landmines at 50 mph, the Pookie would substantially improve convoy travelling times and troop safety. Running at least 100 metres ahead of a convoy, an alteration of tone in his earphones would tell the driver that he had gone over a landmine. The highly sensitive Milton detectors could pick up a metal bottle cap, but training and experience meant that drivers were able to recognise a landmine’s signature tone.",

    "text": "Chesterfield’s Military Heritage\n\n\n\n\nMention of this Derbyshire market town’s name invariably conjures up an image of an iconic landmark: the crooked church steeple. It does, however, also speak of a military heritage built up over a millennium. The word Chester itself is derived from the ancient Roman fort or ‘castrum’: military garrisons that peppered the English countryside during the occupation. In 1266, at the Battle of Chesterfield, Royal forces quashed a rebellion by local barons. Come the English Civil War 400 years later, anti-Royalist sentiment was still strong. Chesterfield deployed militia, together with a ‘company of foot’ from Derby, to defend the town from the King’s forces.\n\nIn the 19th Century, the British Empire, a sprawling global property, demanded defending from armed threat. The Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire regiments of foot, later to be amalgamated as the Sherwood Foresters, attracted volunteers from the Borough of Chesterfield. Egypt and South Africa became household names, and with the outbreak of the Great War, hundreds answered Kitchener’s call. The Western Front claimed the lives of many of the town’s sons, their names commemorated in churches and on memorials throughout the town and satellite villages.\nWWII saw Chesterfield’s citizens enlisting with battalions of the Sherwood Foresters, serving in theatres such as the Western Desert, Italy, France and South East Asia. So also came tales of acts of courage and bravery: in WWI, Fred Greaves, awarded one of the regiment’s first VCs; in WWII, Arthur Norman Crookes, the unique recipient of three DFCs and the American DFC. There were others.\nPublisher: ‎Amberley Publishing (15 July 2016)\nPaperback and Kindle:‎ 96 pages\nISBN: 9781445649764\nAmazon\n\n\n\n\nDerby in 50 Buildings\n\n\n\n\nStraddling the Derwent River, the cathedral city of Derby, its foundations in the Roman occupation of Britain, can directly attribute its contemporary status to the Industrial Revolution. Spinning mills proliferated from the 18th Century, initially relying on waterpower to produce 100 percent British cotton cloth. Victorian ingenuity and innovation became synonymous with the rapid industrial and commercial expansion that ensued – Arkwright and Pickford became household names. Derby quickly evolved into a transport and ancillary manufacturing hub in the Midlands, becoming a centre for the British rail industry and the assembly of the iconic Rolls Royce luxury motor car.\n\nThe subsequent development of the Rolls Royce Merlin aircraft engine, which powered the WWII Spitfires and Hawker Hurricanes, launched the company’s proud status to what it is today: the world’s second largest manufacturer of jet engines and, together with the Toyota car assembly plant, the biggest employer in Derby.\nThis book reveals the rich and diverse history that is reflected in Derby’s architecture as, through successive decades of growth, its character, built of brick and stone, underwent varying nuances of transformation. Sprinkled within this panorama, however, are the symbols of a modern city: ultra-modern structures, thought by some to be the antithesis of Derby’s true architectural heritage.\nPublisher: ‎Amberley Publishing (15 April 2016)\nPaperback and Kindle:‎ 96 pages\nISBN: 9781445658155\nAmazon\n\n\n\n\nEchoes of the Coventry Blitz\n\n\n\n\n‘Smoke rises in the City of Three Spires, the smouldering remnant of the Nazi hate. Coventry and England will remember and repay’. From August 1940, Hitler’s Luftwaffe mercilessly and indiscriminately bombed cities and towns in Britain. The historic West Midlands city of Coventry did not escape the carnage as, night after night, high-explosive and incendiary bombs rained down on the hapless production centre of cars, munitions and aero engines. Then came Operation Mondscheinsonate (Moonlight Sonata), in which thirteen waves of more than 500 German Heinkel bombers sparked an inferno of hundreds of fires, including a devastating and uncontrollable firestorm.\n\nOn this fateful night of 14 November 1940, 4,400 homes were destroyed and two-thirds of the buildings in the city centre sustained structural damage. Today, the iconic shell of Coventry’s once majestic medieval cathedral offers a silent memorial of remembrance to that dreadful night. For the city’s residents of now, it is a poignant echo of a violent and destructive part of their history.\nWith the digital juxtaposing of archival images with photographs taken by the author himself for this publication, and drawing from contemporary press accounts of the Coventry Blitz, this book presents a totally unique comparative insight into the Nazi bombing of Coventry in the Second World War.\nPublisher: ‎Pen & Sword History (6 Aug. 2018)\nPaperback and Kindle:‎ 199 pages\nISBN: 9781526709677\nAmazon Pen & Sword\n\n\n\n\nMansfield Through Time\n\n\n\n\nThis book offers a cameo glimpse of a town whose character and identity has, over the last few hundred years, been moulded, modified and tempered by coal mining and the Industrial Revolution. This ancient market town evolved into Nottinghamshire’s second largest town, a strategic trading hub from which roads radiate to all cardinal points. With the surrounding area rich in coal deposits and bountiful farmland, corn and textile milling developed alongside a rapidly expanding beer brewing industry.\n\nThe latter half of the 20th Century, however, witnessed the demise of both the coalmines and breweries. Engineering companies shut down and the mills closed their doors permanently. The town, to a large extent, reverted to its commercial roots, as it strived towards the regeneration of prosperity lost to the influences of multi-national economics. Much of Mansfield’s past, previously invested in transient buildings and structures, now only exist as sepia images stored in archives. This book offers a comparative—and nostalgic—look at how the town has changed through time.\nPublisher: ‎‎Amberley Publishing (15 September 2016)\nPaperback and Kindle:‎ 96 pages\nISBN: 9781445659572\nAmazon\n\n\n\n\nNottingham’s Military Legacy\n\n\n\n\nTwo years after landing on English soil in 1066, William of Normandy erected a strategic castle at Nottingham, thereby creating an enduring military nexus through to the modern era. On 22 August 1642, in his endeavours to quash Parliamentarian insurrection in the Midlands, King Charles raised his standard over Nottingham Castle, a rallying call to all Royalists to support their monarch. Loyalty to the Crown was, however, divided, and before long Parliamentarian forces garrisoned the castle. Late in the eighteenth century, a town troop of Yeomanry was raised in Nottingham, the foundation of the future South Notts Yeomanry.\n\nThe yeomanry assisted regular troops by helping restore peace during the so-called Bread Riots of 1795, at a time when many of the town’s men had been committed to military duty during the French Revolutionary Wars. Five troops of the town’s yeomanry were again called up for service during the civil unrest of the Luddite Riots of 1811–18. This pattern of service continued over several decades. Evolving into a regiment, the yeomanry were repeatedly deployed against civil dissenters – the Nottingham Riot, and the Reform Bill and Chartist Riots.\nAfter seeing combat during the Peninsula Wars in 1815, in the latter half of the 1800s, the 59th (2nd Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot formed part of a British invasion force into Afghanistan from India, to curb Russian interventionism in this remote and desolate region.\nThe outbreak of war in distant South Africa in 1899 placed enormous strain on Britain’s military capability. From Nottingham and other county towns, regiments of yeomanry, Hussars and Sherwood Rangers were dispatched to the hostile environment of the African veld. Nottingham’s sons then answered a call to arms in their thousands, only to also perish in their thousands on the Godforsaken soils of France and Flanders during the holocaust that was the Great War.\nThrough the Second World War to the present, Nottingham’s military units underwent successive phases of metamorphosis – from infantry to anti-aircraft and searchlight formations, followed by the relatively recent absorption into a regional entity: the Mercian Regiment. Today, Nottingham’s castle and surrounds bear the symbols of a rich and diverse military legacy—symbols of remembrance, of tribute, and of a tableau of military pride from ancient times.\nPublisher: ‎Pen & Sword Military (17 July 2017)\nPaperback and Kindle:‎ 128 pages\nISBN: 9781526707581\nAmazon Pen & Sword\n\n\n\n\nSheffield’s Military Legacy\n\n\n\n\nIn the century following the Norman invasion, a castle was built at the confluence of the rivers Sheaf and Don, an early recognition of Sheffield’s strategic importance. Destroyed in the thirteenth century during the Second Barons’ War, a second castle was built on the site, but in 1647, it was ordered to be demolished immediately after the cessation of the Civil War, thereby negating any future tactical use by either Parliamentarian or Royalist. Steel production and downstream manufacturing would, however, be perpetually embedded in the military legacy of this seat of industrial innovation and production.\n\nThe Vickers steel foundry was established in Sheffield in 1828. Following the manufacture of the factory’s first artillery in 1890, Sheffield expanded to find itself a leading supplier in the First World War, feeding the military with ammunition shells, guns and cannons for ships, armour plating, aircraft parts, torpedoes, helmets and bayonets. Sheffield’s major contribution to the British war machine in the Second World War quickly attracted the attention of Nazi Germany. In December 1940, in an operation appropriately codenamed Schmelztiegel, or Crucible, for the method of steel production, Sheffield suffered two major raids aimed primarily at steel and munitions factories.\nA centuries-old proud tradition of answering a call to the colours spawned formation titles of courage and dedicated service—the 84th Regiment of Foot, the Loyal Independent Sheffield Volunteers of the 1700s, the Hallamshire Rifle Volunteers raised in 1859, and the Sheffield Squadron, Yeomanry Cavalry. The 1899–1902 Anglo-Boer War would also have an enduring legacy on the town, as many volunteered to fight on the sub-continent. The Sheffield Wednesday football stadium was given the name Spioen Kop, after the famous battle in South Africa, while local road names include Ladysmith Avenue and Mafeking Place.\nOn 1 July 1916, the Sheffield City Battalion fought in a heroic and costly, but hopeless, action on the Somme to capture the village of Serre, and through the Second World War right up to Afghanistan, Sheffield’s men and women in uniform were not found wanting. Sheffield’s rich military legacy portrayed in this publication is drawn from a cross section of representative units, home and foreign actions, uniformed personalities, barracks at the hub of musters, the calibre of gallantry—including six Victoria Crosses—as well as the immortality of names on memorials, such as the Sheffield Memorial Park in France.\nPublisher: ‎Pen & Sword Military (29 November 2017)\nPaperback and Kindle:‎ 128 pages\nISBN: 9781526707628\nAmazon Pen & Sword",

    "text": "Irgun: Revisionist Zionism 1931–48\n\n\n\n\nIn October 1944, the US Office of Strategic Services described the Irgun Tsvai Leumi— National Military Organization—as “an underground, quasi-military organization with headquarters in Palestine … fanatical Zionists who wish to convert Palestine and Transjordan into an independent Jewish state … advocate the use of force both against the Arabs and the British to achieve this maximal political goal.” In 1925, Ze’ev Jabotinsky founded the Revisionist Zionism organization, whose non- religious, right-wing ideology would lead to the formation of the Irgun and, ultimately, of the Likud Party.\n\nCommencing operations in the British Mandate of Palestine in 1931, Irgun adopted a mainly guarding role, while facilitating the ongoing immigration of Jews into Palestine. In 1936, Irgun guerrillas started attacking Arab targets, killing more than 250 by the end of the Second World War. The British White Paper of 1939 rejected the establishment of a Jewish nation and, as a direct consequence, Irgun guerrillas started targeting the British.\nThe authorities executed captured Irgun operatives found guilty of terrorism, while deporting hundreds to internment camps overseas. As details of Jewish genocide—the Holocaust—emerged, Irgun declared war on the British in Palestine. Acts of infrastructural sabotage gave way to the bombing of buildings and police stations, the worst being the bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem—the hub of British operations and administration—in July 1946, killing 91.\nFreedom fighters or terrorists, Irgun was only dissolved when the independent Jewish state of Israel was born on 14 May 1948.

    "text": "Magazine articles\n\nChariot of Fire: Israeli Merkava Tank\n\nClassic Military Vehicle March 2022\n\n\nFor many analysts, the Valley of Tears tank battle between Israeli and Syrian armour that took place on the Golan Heights in October 1973 was one of history’s greatest. On the Hebrew holy day of Yom Kippur, on 6 October Egyptian and Syrian forces simultaneously attacked Israeli-occupied Sinai and the Golan Heights respectively.\nAlso referred to as the 1973 Arab–Israeli War, or the Fourth Arab–Israeli War, the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) faced vastly superior numbers of infantry, armour and artillery. On the Golan, opposite the Purple Line, around 1,500 Soviet-made Syrian tanks, many the latest T-62, lined up against seemingly paltry Israeli armoured defences comprising 100 US M60 Paton and upgraded British Centurion battle tanks.\nThe two Israeli armoured brigades—37th and 188th—miraculously held their positions, but at great cost. The 188th was reduced to a handful of serviceable tanks and had lost 90 per cent of its officers. IDF reinforcements arrived at the eleventh hour, pushing back the Syrian attack. In the three days the Syrians lost about 250 tanks. For Israel, the Yom Kippur War was painful evidence that the IDF’s armoured capabilities urgently needed revisiting.\nAfter assuming command of IDF armoured forces in 1964, Major General Israel ‘Talik’ Tal (1924–2010) transformed Israeli armour into the leading element of the IDF. Former commander of the 7th Armored Brigade, Tal’s armour doctrine of high mobility, relentless assault and long-distance fire exploiting Arab tactical weaknesses during the 1967 Six Day War ensured Israeli victory.\nHowever, Tel Aviv’s reliance on the United States, France and Britain for its armour requirements and associated technology stifled any desires the nation had of armour that would outclass that which the Soviet Union provided to her Arab neighbours. This compelled Israel to address a skewed balance of power in the region by establishing a suitable infrastructure for the development and construction of an Israeli ‘blue and white’ tank, relying on local industries and homegrown technological research and innovation.\nHeading the IDF Armored Corps’ development team for Israel’s own main battle tank (MBT), Chief Armor Officer General Tal initiated the programme in 1971 by setting the prime imperative of protection of the most valuable resource—the tank crew, or in his words, “Man at the centre of the matter”. Firepower would come next in priority, followed by mobility.\nFrom initial plasticine, fibre-glass and wooden scale models, the prominent design feature was a state of the art low-profile turret which, like that of the American M60A2 MBT, had a turret that was narrower than the turret ring.\nIn pursuance of maximising crew protection, and in what became known as double- spaced armour, turret protection was based on double walls, with some cavities also providing storage space for items such as 60mm mortar bombs. The 62-ton super tank was fitted with a cannon almost identical to the 105mm L7/M68 rifled gun found on the Centurion Mk5. The decision drew criticism for not being innovative. Not only had the IDF employed this gun for a decade already when upgrading Pattons and Centurions, but many believed that the new Soviet T-72’s 125mm gun was superior. A thermal sleeve was fitted to the gun, giving greater accuracy in firing by providing a more consistent temperature to the gun barrel and so preventing distortions due to thermal expansion caused by the temperature differences around the barrel when firing. Rounds for the cannon were stored 6 ready to use just below the turret ring, 12 in two cylinders at the rear base of the hull, and 44 in 4-round containers at the very rear of the tank. A blend of the traditional, conventional and innovative, notwithstanding numerous disappointing features, the Merkava Mk1 was, in the words of Lieutenant Colonel (Res) Martin Mass of the Armored Corps Memorial Site and Museum (Yad La-Shiryon) at Latrun,\n“The very development and self-production of a major combat system for the ground forces in response to the difficulty of orderly procurement constituted a significant revolution whose results and impact we see today.”\nThe first Mk1 prototype was completed in 1974, followed in 1977 by the commencement of the initial production of the first batch of 40 tanks. Full-scale production started in 1979 when it was officially adopted by the IDF, and ceased in 1983 after 250 had been built. In 1982, production commenced on the Merkava Mk2 and lasted until 1989 after 580 were built.\nThe Merkava Mk3 first appeared in the public domain in 1989. Although production ceased in 2003 after 780 had been built, this version is still widely employed by the IDF. Maintaining its philosophy of affording tank crews optimum protection, the Mk3 had added passive modular armour, which could be easily replaced in the field.\nIn 2018, the IDF Armored Corps unveiled the highly advanced Merkava Mk4 ‘Barak’ variant, employing artificial intelligence for the first time to assist the crew with intricate aspects of combat management. Virtual reality simulation using the innovative ‘Iron View’ helmet optimises crew training beyond compare.",

    "text": "The Berlin Blockade: Soviet Chokehold on Berlin and the Great Allied Airlift 1948–49\n\n\n\n\nWith a pathological hatred of the other’s ideology that had spawned total mistrust, the paucity of belief in a non-aggression pact between Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin in a short space of time catapulted the two nations into a bitter conflagration of Biblical proportions. As Montgomery struggled to shake the sand of the Normandy beaches off his boots, followed by major setbacks in the Ardennes and at Arnhem, the Red Army brutally wiped out the Fuhrer’s seat of power. Allied agreements entered into at Teheran, Yalta and Potsdam for the carving up of post-war Berlin now meant nothing to the Soviet conquerors.\n\nTheir victory cost millions ofRussian lives – troops and civilians – so the hammer and sickle hoisted atop the Reichstag was more a claim to ownership than success.\nMoscow’s agenda was clear and simple: the Western Allies had to leave Berlin peacefully or by escalating pressure. The blockade ensued as the Russians orchestrated a determined programme of harassment, intimidation, flexing of muscle, and Socialist propaganda to force the Allies out.\nBritain and America would not be cowed. History’s largest airborne relief programme was introduced to save the beleaguered city. Truman had already used the atomic weapon with unprecedented results, while Stalin amassed enormous armies east of the Iron Curtain. In a war of attrition, diplomatic bluff and backstabbing, and mobilising of forces, the West braced itself for a third world war.\nThis account is drawn entirely from the British press of the day.\nPublisher: ‎Pen & Sword Military (2017)\nPaperback: 128 pages\nISBN: 9781526708267\nAmazon Pen & Sword\n\n\n\n\nMalayan Emergency: Triumph of the Running Dogs 1948–1960\n\n\n\n\nStaggering under the immeasurable cost of the ‘good fight’, post-war Britain was immediately confronted with an imploding empire, where overseas territories over which the Crown held varying levels of control clamoured for self-determination. For predominantly ethnic Chinese radical activists, this translated as Merdeka—independence—for a conglomerate of states, sultanates and islands that London referred to as British Malaya. By the time of the Second World War, Japanese occupation of the Malay Peninsula and Singapore, the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) had already been working on freedom from Britain. The Japanese conquerors, however, were also the loathsome enemies of the MCP’s ideological brothers in China.\n\nAn alliance of convenience with the British was the outcome. Britain armed and trained the MCP’s military wing, the Malayan People’s Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA), to essentially wage jungle guerrilla warfare against Japanese occupying forces. With the cessation of hostilities, anti-Japanese became anti-British and, using the same weapons and training fortuitously provided by the British army during the war, the MCP launched a guerrilla war of insurgency.\nMalaya was of significant strategic and economic importance to Britain. In the face of an emerging communist regime in China, a British presence in Southeast Asia was imperative. Equally, rubber and tin, largely produced in Malaya by British expatriates, were important inputs for British industry.\nTypically, the insurgents, dubbed communist terrorists, or simply CTs, went about attacking soft targets in remote areas: the owners, managers and infrastructure of the rubber plantations and tin mines. In conjunction with this was the implementation of Chairman Mao’s dictate of subverting the rural, largely peasant rural population to the cause. Twelve years of counter-insurgency operations ensued, as a wide range of British forces were joined in the conflict by ground, air and sea units from Australia, New Zealand, Southern Rhodesia, Fiji, Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia.\nPublisher: ‎Pen & Sword Military (2017)\nPaperback: 128 pages\nISBN: 9781526707864\nAmazon Pen & Sword\n\n\n\n\nRed China: Mao Crushes the Kuomintang, 1949\n\n\n\n\nIt is 30 years since the end of the Cold War. It began over 75 years ago, in 1944 long before the last shots of the Second World War had echoed across the wastelands of Eastern Europe with the brutal Greek Civil War. The battle lines are no longer drawn, but they linger on, unwittingly or not, in conflict zones such as Syria, Somalia and Ukraine. In an era of mass-produced AK-47s and ICBMs, one such flashpoint was China in 1949 when two vast armies prepared for a final showdown that would decide Asia’s future. One is led by Mao Tse-tung and his military strategists Zhou Enlai and Zhu De. Hardened by years of guerrilla warfare, armed and trained by the Soviets, and determined to emerge victorious, the People’s Liberation Army is poised to strike from its Manchurian stronghold.\n\nOpposing them are the teetering divisions of the Kuomintang, the KMT. For two decades, Chiang Kai-shek’s nationalist regime had sought to fashion China into a modern state. But years spent battling warlords and enduring Japan s brutal conquest of their homeland had left the KMT weak, corrupt and divided.\nMillions of Chinese perished during the crucible of the Sino-Japanese War and the long, gruelling years of the Second World War. But the Soviet victory against the Japanese Kwantung Army in 1945 allowed Mao’s communists to re-arm and prepare for the coming civil war. Within a few short years, the KMT were on the defensive while the Communists possessed the most formidable army in East Asia. The stage was set for China’s rebirth as a communist dictatorship ruled by a megalomaniac who would become the biggest mass- murderer in history.\nPublisher: ‎Pen & Sword Military (2018)\nPaperback: 128 pages\nISBN: 9781526708106\nAmazon Pen & Sword\n\n\n\n\nSino–Indian War: Border Clash October–November 1962\n\n\n\n\nFor a hundred years, British and Chinese territorial claims in the Himalayas were in dispute, with Indian historians claiming that the region was the fountainhead of Hindu civilization. In the halcyon days of the British Raj, London saw Afghanistan and Tibet as buffers from Russian and Chinese imperialism. In 1913, an ephemeral agreement between Britain, Tibet and China was signed, recognizing the McMahon Line as the border of the disputed territory. China, however, failed to ratify the agreement, while India protested against a loss of historical land.\n\nAfter the Second World War, India became independent of Britain and the Chinese Communists proclaimed a people’s republic. Despite cordial overtures from Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in late 1950 the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) invaded Tibet. In the ensuing twelve years, Indian diplomacy and Chinese ‘cartographic aggression’ were punctuated by incidents along the border, particularly in 1953 when armed clashes precipitated a significant increase in the disposition of troops by both sides. In the spring of 1962, Indian forces struck into the Ladakh region of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, hoping to push the Chinese back.\nIn a spiralling game of brinkmanship, in September ground forces were deployed and redeployed to gain strategic security. On 10 October, 33 Chinese died in a firefight near Dhola.\nEmbittered by Moscow’s support of India against a sister communist state, and in a bid to clip Nehru’s belligerent wings, on 20 October the PLA launched a two-pronged attack against Indian positions in the region. Ironically, this was at the same time as the Cuban missile crisis.\nPublisher: ‎Pen & Sword Military (2018)\nPaperback: 128 pages\nISBN: 9781526728371\nAmazon Pen & Sword",

In 1819, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles founded Singapore—described as the ancient maritime capital of the Malays—as a British colony on the southern tip of the archipelago, deserving “its attention to the commercial and political interests of our country”.\nBy 1921, 1.3 million acres of Malaysia was under rubber, mainly on the Malayan peninsula. Of this acreage, expatriate Europeans owned 75 per cent of the large, estate plantations. By 1940, this had spread to over 2.1 million acres.\nWhen the Malay sultans rejected Whitehall’s proposals for a Malayan Union in 1946, the powerful and well-organised communist party clamoured for greater recognition of the part they played in the future of the Far East. Successive attempts by the British to devolve greater political and administrative independence to a union of Malay states and islands were also shunned. Printed Maoist propaganda exhorted Malaysians to:\n“Rise up quickly, gather your strength, inspect your troops, use your sword and pistol, put an end to the efforts of the militarists, and overthrow the murderous policy of British imperialism. Establish a Soviet Government of labourers, peasants, and soldiers. We must unite all Malays, Klings, and Indians, and rise up. Long live the success of the world revolution”.\nAt first light on Saturday, April 10, 1948, British army troops and Malayan police conducted an ‘anti-bandit’ operation into an area of North Perak, on the border with Siam. Intelligent sources had indicated that up to 400 ‘armed guerrillas’ had established themselves in the border jungles between the two countries. Subversion was found to be total. The guerrillas had formed a government in the area and were extorting taxes from the people. Levels of intimidation were such that the villagers refused to cooperate with the authorities by identifying their Chinese Communist masters. Two months later, escalating guerrilla activities forced the British administration to declare a state of emergency in Malaya. About 90 per cent of the communist terrorists, or CTs as they would commonly be called, were ethnic Chinese, the balance mainly Malay and Indian, with one or two Siamese, Japanese and Javanese. Generally young, the CTs were jungle habituated, attuned to the lay of the land in which they operated. Hardened survivalists, they understood deprivation and the necessity of living off the jungle. Their fieldcraft and tracking skills were, for the majority, second nature in the familiar environment.\nThe CTs employed simple tactics in the model of Mao Zedong’ s rural revolution: swift, random, hit-and-run attacks that were brutal in the extreme. Murder and terror would be the norm. The CTs’ biggest advantage in the jungle battleground was the element of surprise, where ambush-encompassed killing zones could be meticulously laid out for optimum results.\nIn 1950, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshall Bill Slim, appointed Lieutenant General Sir Harold Briggs KCIE, KBE, CB, DSO and two Bars, as Director of Operations in Malaya. The retired Briggs was a Second World War veteran of the Western Desert, East Africa, Persia and Burma theatres of war.\nHis name would become synonymous with the forced resettlement of rural populations into guarded internment camps in Malaya to deprive the insurgents of local support such as food and intelligence. Likely a strategy copying that employed so tragically by the British during the Second Boer War in South Africa, in later years Briggs’s model of isolation through collectivisation of a rural population would be emulated by Portugal in her African colonies, called aldeamentos, and by the widespread construction of protected villages by the Rhodesian government during that country’s counter-insurgency war of the 1970s. A legally questionable strategy, it was to be a major contributing factor to Britain’s victory over the MNLA.\nAs early as 1950, it had already become apparent to the British media that, by simple interpretation of the statistics, Britain’s fiscus was under tremendous strain putting out fires in, among others, Palestine, Berlin and Malaya. Military success measured in terms of kill rates as a ratio to loss of own forces made uncomfortable, if not pitiful, reading. Public opinion, therefore, tended to agree with Commissioner General Malcolm MacDonald who was quoted as saying, “Only a fool would say the situation is getting better,” a comment that was at direct variance with that of the late High Commissioner Sir Henry Gurney who believed that there was no doubt that the government was making good progress in the ‘the bandit war’.\nThere was no ceasefire. ‘Running Dogs’ was the derogatory term used by the Malayan communists when referring to the British and those of the colony’s population who remained loyal to Britain.\nWith the independence of Malaya on August 31, 1957, the communists’ raison d’être for their ‘liberation struggle’ evaporated. The last significant engagement with CTs took place in a swamp in the Telok Anson area of Perak in 1958, resulting in the guerrillas surrendering. Small, scattered groups of CTs sought refuge across the Thai border and beyond.\nOn July 31, 1960, the state of emergency was declared over. Chin Peng left Thailand for Beijing, where the Chinese International Liaison Bureau provided him and other Southeast Asian revolutionaries with a roof over their heads. Britain, the lesson learned, sensibly stayed out of Vietnam, electing instead to concentrate on NATO and the Cold War threat in Europe.\n\n\n\n\nSoviet Armour Graveyard, Afghanistan\n\nClassic Military Vehicle November 2021\n\n\nIn October 1979, factional communist rival and Afghan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hafizullah Amin, ordered the assassination of the Afghan president, communist Taraki Nur Mohamed, founder member of the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) that had seized power a year earlier.\nAmin assumed power, but Moscow labelled him “a power-hungry leader who is distinguished by brutality and treachery,” whose dealings with the Kremlin were insincere and duplicitous. For long reluctant to respond to Amin’s appeals for assistance, or to intervene directly, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and the Politburo, driven by growing concerns that the Soviet was going to lose control over a region of strategic interest, decided to act.\nFollowing a phased, relatively limited deployment of troops and assets over several weeks, on December 27, 1979, Soviet airborne forces attacked the Presidential Palace in Kabul, during which Amin was killed. The Soviets replaced him with Karmal Babrak, and over the next two days the Soviet Fortieth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Yuri Tukharinov, invaded Afghanistan. The force comprised three motor rifle divisions (MRD) and the 103rd Airborne Division.\nAll the while, the counter-revolutionary Mujahideen, aided by Pakistan, Iran and the USA, continued to increase their armed activities against anyone or anything—especially the Amin regime—that represented a threat to their centuries-old socio-political existence centred on family, tribe and religion. Any semblance of national unity has historically been the consequence of outsiders trying to impose alien rule on the country, such as the nineteenth century British.\nAlthough largely untrained, the hardy Mujahideen were thoroughly accustomed to the use of weapons in a part of the world where conflict resolution through the barrel of a gun was endemically ingrained in their lives.\nThe main weapons of the Mujahideen had to be compatible with the mobile tactics of guerrilla warfare. They were therefore equipped with the ubiquitous AK-47 assault rifle, PK light machine guns and the RPG-7 anti-tank rocket grenade launcher. The employment of 60mm, 82mm, and sometimes 107mm mortars, 82mm recoilless anti-tank guns, BM-1 single 107mm rocket launchers, and 7.62mm and 12.7mm heavy machine guns became more widespread. These tribal fighters were also enthusiastic proponents of landmine warfare, which the Soviets discovered at their expense, losing 1,191 vehicles and 1,995 men to mines.\nVery little of Afghanistan’s terrain is suited to mechanised warfare, that relied on unhindered manoeuvrability and superior firepower, and in fact, provided the Mujahideen with an enormous strategic advantage. There were no railways and only 11,000 miles of roads, of which only one sixth was paved. The national Afghan Army was largely unable—or disinclined—to take on the warlords. This was the start of a ten-year occupation. Four years later, to the day, ABC World News presenter Peter Jennings reported with remarkable foresight:\n“Four years after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, an unwinnable war drags on, unwinnable for either side. These are some of the Afghan guerrillas who prevented a Soviet victory, but they’ve not prevented Soviet domination.\n“There are slightly more than 100,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan, which is about the size of Texas. U.S. intelligence estimates it costs the Soviets about $3 billion. Why, after four years, have the Soviets not done better? First they miscalculated because they couldn’t control the Communist regime that took over in 1978, and then they miscalculated in 1979 because they thought that they could be in for six months and stabilize things and leave. What superpowers often do, they forget that the mere presence of foreign soldiers in other countries becomes the main issue.”\nBy 1984, the American Central Intelligence Agency CIA) estimated that, since the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the Soviets had suffered roughly 25,000 casualties, including about 8,000 killed. They had lost over 600 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, and thousands of armoured vehicles and trucks. Casualties in the Afghan Army were around 67,000 and insurgent casualties at some 40,000. Analysts would describe the conflict as “the Soviet Union’s Vietnam War.”\nBetween 1980–85, Soviet forces in Afghanistan lost 655 armoured vehicles and 340 tanks, and a staggering 5,250 tracks for armoured vehicles. Landmines, often stacked in threes, and remotely detonated explosive devices exacted a major toll on Soviet armour. According to the same 1987 CIA report mentioned above, the Soviets deployed an estimated 40 T-54/55 and 690 T-62 main battle tanks (MBTs).\nBy the late 1980s, there was mounting criticism of the Afghan war in the Soviet media and by the man in the street, likening the conflict to the disastrous Vietnam War. Early in 1987, the demobilisation of Soviet conscripts in Afghanistan commenced. This was followed by the Fortieth Army starting their official withdrawal in May 1988, and in February 1989, the last Soviet troops left.\nOn February 11, 1989, as the massive convoy of the Soviet Army Western Afghanistan Division trundled through the Afghan border town of Towraghondi and into the Soviet Union, armoured assault leader Lieutenant Viktor Yevdokimov said to accompanying British journalist Arthur Kent, “We could have tried anything, and the outcome would have been the same. It’s time to go home.”\nAnd right now, 32 years later, Britain and the United States are also withdrawing their troops from that eclectic amalgam of fiercely zealous tribes and warlord polities that the rest of the world calls Afghanistan.",

    "text": "North Korea Invades the South: Across the 38th Parallel June 1950\n\n\n\n\nThe attack upon South Korea made it plain beyond all doubt that communism had passed beyond the use of subversion to conquer independent nations and would now use armed invasion and war. A week after his reaction to the North Korean invasion south across the 38th Parallel, US President Harry S. Truman, in compliance with a UN Security Council resolution, appointed that iconic Second World War veteran, General Douglas MacArthur, commander- in-chief of forces in Korea.\n\nWithout warning, at 4.00 a.m. on 25 June 1950, North Korean artillery laid down a heavy bombardment on the Ongjin Peninsula, followed four hours later by a massive armoured, air, amphibious and infantry breach of the ill-conceived post-war ‘border’ that was the 38º North line of latitude. At 11.00 a.m. North Korea issued a declaration of war on the Republic of Korea. Three days later, the South Korean capital, Seoul, fell.\nIn August 1945, the capitulation of the Japanese precipitated a hastily agreed-to delineation of American and Soviet zones of occupation on the Korean peninsula, pending a merging of the two Koreas into a single, unified state. By the summer of 1948, tensions escalated dramatically between north and south, the former adamant that South Korea belonged to them.\nThe unprepared and understrength American Far East Command in Japan rapidly airlifted combat elements of the US 24th Division to avoid a total rout in Korea at the hands of the committed North Korean supremo, Marshal Choi Yung Kun. Within days, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee placed the Royal Navy in Japanese waters at Truman’s disposal. The decisions by the two erstwhile war allies, to act in accordance with a UN mandate for the use of force was, however, not fully endorsed by their respective legislatures or electorates—wounds from the just-ended global conflict were still raw.\nWhilst blaming the hostilities on South Korea and ‘all who stand behind their back’, the Soviets formally declared that they would adhere to the principle of non-interference by foreign powers in the internal affairs of Korea.\nThe first in a six-volume series on the Korean War, this publication considers those first few fateful days in June 1950 that would cement north-south antagonism to this day, the pariah state that is communist North Korea a seemingly increasing threat to an already tenuous global peace in the Cold War era.\nPublisher: ‎Pen & Sword Military (2018)\nPaperback: 128 pages\nISBN: 9781526708182\nAmazon Pen & Sword\n\n\n\n\nNorth Korean Onslaught: UN Stand at Pusan August–September 1950\n\n\n\n\nIn the first volume in this series on the Korean War, North Korea Invades the South, North Korean ground forces, armour and artillery crossed the 38th Parallel, and, in blitzkrieg style, roll back US and South Korean forces down the Korean peninsula.Despite the United States and South Korea committing army, air force and navy units,supported by forces from Australia, Britain, New Zealand, France and Canada, by 31 July eleven North Korean divisions were concentrated in a disconnected line from Chŏnju to Yŏngdong.\n\nAlong the south coast, the North Koreans pushed eastwards towards Masan. To the east and centre of the peninsula, they closed in on Kimch’ŏn and the Naktong River line. On the east coast, three North Korean divisions secured the Yŏngdŏk–P’ohang axis, placing them within mortar range of the UN Yŏnil Airfield.\nReeling back, the UN forces desperately defended the 140-mile line lodgement area that incorporated the port of Pusan (now Busan). Supreme commander of the UN forces, General Douglas MacArthur, had his back to the sea, facing thirteen enemy infantry divisions, two new tank brigades and an armoured division.\nOn 1 September, North Korean forces launched their strongest offensive to date, and in the first two weeks of the month American casualties were the heaviest of the war. Of particular concern to the commander of the US Eighth Army, Lieutenant General Walton Walker, was the danger of losing the town of Taegu in the centre. The resultant loss of the strategic Taegu–Pusan railway would be catastrophic.\nMacArthur and Washington were running out of options, but the Pusan Perimeter had to be defended at all costs.\nPublisher: ‎Pen & Sword Military (2018)\nPaperback: 128 pages\nISBN: 9781526728338\nAmazon Pen & Sword\n\n\n:::\n\n\nInchon Landing: MacArthur’s Korean War Masterstroke, September 1950\n\n\n\n\nIn the first two volumes in the author’s series on battles of the Korean War, North Korean ground forces, armour and artillery crossed the 38th Parallel into South Korea, inflicting successive ignominious defeats on the ill-prepared US-led UN troops as they pushed them ever southward into a tiny defensive enclave—the Pusan Perimeter—on the tip of the Korean Peninsula. General Douglas MacArthur, Second World War veteran of the South East Asia and Pacific theatres of war, met with considerable resistance to his plans for a counteroffensive from both the corridors of power in Washington and from his staff\n\nin South Korea and Japan: it was typhoon season, the approaches to the South Korean port city of Inch’ŏn were not conducive to amphibious assault, and it would leave the besieged Pusan Perimeter in great danger of being overrun.\nHowever, the controversial MacArthur’s obstinate persistency prevailed, and with a mere three weeks to go, the US X Corps was activated to execute the invasion on D-Day: 15 September 1950.\nElements of the US Marine Corps landed successfully on the scheduled day, and with the element of surprise on their side, immediately struck east to Seoul, only 15 miles away. The next day, General Walker’s Eighth Army broke out of the beleaguered Pusan Perimeter to complete the southerly envelopment of North Korean forces.\nSeoul fell on the 25th. MacArthur’s impulsive gamble had paid off, and the South Korean government moved back to their capital. The North Koreans had been driven north of the 38th Parallel, effectively bringing to an end their invasion of the south that started on 25 June 1950.\nPublisher: ‎Pen & Sword Military (2019)\nPaperback: 128 pages\nISBN: 9781526756961\nAmazon Pen & Sword\n\n\n:::\n\n\nAllied Surge: Pyongyang Falls, UN Sweep to the Yalu October 1950\n\n\n\n\nIn the author’s first three volumes in a series on battles of the Korean War, North Korean forces illegally cross the 38th Parallel, rolling back US and South Korean forces into a small corner of the Korean peninsula. Months later, commander of the United Nations Command (UNC) forces in Korea, General Douglas MacArthur, launches a daring counter-offensive invasion at Inch’ŏn, enveloping North Korean forces and liberating Seoul. Despite a warning from Beijing that it would intervene if US forces crossed the 38th, MacArthur used the UN’s conditional authorization to land elements of the US X Corps at Wonsan and Riwon in North Korea.\n\nThe Eighth Army and South Korean forces captured the North Korean capital, P’yŏngyang, while American paratroops made the first combat jump of the conflict at Sunch’ŏn and Sukch’ŏn, cutting the road to the Chinese border.\nTowards the end of September, the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), arrived for attachment to the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, joining the first battalions of the Middlesex Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and Leicestershire Regiment.\nWhile MacArthur’s ground forces edged closer to the Yalu River, and the general having designs of chasing the retiring North Koreans across the river into China, in October 1950 the Chinese politburo deployed 200,000 members of the 13th Army Group of the newly titled People’s Volunteer Army (PLA) on a pre-emptive ‘defensive’ operation into North Korea.\nAlbeit that the Soviet Union refused to become directly involved in the Korean fight, the imminent arrival of more than a million Chinese troops onto the North Korean battlefield would inexorably tilt the outcome against the UN forces as fierce battles ensued. The resultant fallout would manifest itself on the Korean Peninsula to this day.\nPublisher: ‎Pen & Sword Military (2019)\nPaperback: 128 pages\nISBN: 9781526756923\nAmazon Pen & Sword\n\n\n\n\nChina Invasion: People’s Liberation Army Crosses the Yalu October 1950–March 1951\n\n\n\n\nIn his first four volumes on the Korean War, the author looked at the North Korean invasion of the south, which pushed back UN forces under General Douglas MacArthur into the Pusan enclave on the southeast tip of the Korean peninsula. Following a daring and highly successful amphibious counterattack at Inch’ŏn, MacArthur liberates Seoul before confidently crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea, with the objective of totally eliminating the North Korean military machine right up to the Chinese Manchurian border.\n\nCommunist Chinese forces, that had been secretly infiltrating North Korean territory by slipping across the Yalu River from mid-October, ambushed a South Korean regiment in the mountains of central North Korea. This would be the first of several Chinese victories over unsuspecting and overstretched South Korean and American units in the winter of 1950–51.\nChinese leader Mao Zedong, ostensibly fearful of the consequences of hostile American forces on his country’s border along the Yalu River, ordered hundreds of thousands of his soldiers into battle in Korea, with express orders to annihilate the UN forces.\nIn the western half of the theatre, US General Walton H. Walker’s Eighth Army front along the Ch’ŏngch’ŏn axis was breeched, while to the east the US X Corps suffered a series of crushing defeats, including at the Chosin Reservoir, precipitating a massive evacuation from the North Korean port of Hungnam.\nAmerican superiority in the Korean War now deteriorated rapidly, as hopes of imminent victory gave way to a desperate struggle for survival against seemingly endless numbers of well-equipped Chinese hordes.\nPublisher: ‎Pen & Sword Military (2020)\nPaperback: 128 pages\nISBN: 9781526778093\nAmazon Pen & Sword\n\n\n\n\nImjin River: Fall of the Glosters to the Armistice April 1951 - July 1953\n\n\n\n\nFrom October 1950, hundreds of thousands of Communist Chinese troops crossed the Yalu River into North Korea, with the singular objective of forcing General Douglas MacArthur’s United Nations troops back across the 38th Parallel and into the Sea of Japan.\nIn a series of major offensives by 27 Chinese divisions, MacArthur sustained successive defeats in his hitherto successful campaign on the Korean Peninsula. For the first time, communist fighter Mig jet aircraft challenged MacArthur’s air superiority.\nShortly before midnight on 22 April 1951, to the west of the US Eighth Army’s defensive front, the Chinese Sixty-third Army fell on the British 29th Brigade.\n\nOn the left flank, the Gloucester Regiment—the ‘Glosters’— held a tenuous position at a ford on the Imjin River. Despite a gallant and costly defence, the battalion was pushed back to make a desperate but futile stand on Hill 235. On what became known as ‘Glosters’ Hill’, the battalion ceased to exist. It was subsequently estimated that the attacking force of 27,000 Chinese troops suffered 10,000 casualties, forcing the army to be withdrawn from the front. The stand and fall of the Glosters continues to be commemorated annually at the regiment’s memorial in the South Korean capital, Seoul.\nFrom August 1951 to the summer of 1952, the USAF conducted Operation Strangle in a futile and costly attempt to disrupt Chinese supply routes. In the last two years of fighting, Communist Chinese and UN forces faced each other from well-entrenched positions in hilly terrain, where mapped hill numbers were contested. From June 1952 to March 1953, a series of five hard-fought engagements took place in central Korea as the antagonists sought ownership of Hill 266, commonly referred to as ‘Old Baldy’. This was followed during April to July 1953 by two tactically pointless battles over Pork Chop Hill, in which the UN forces won the first battle and the Chinese the second, with both sides sustaining major casualties.\nOn 27 July 1953, the two belligerents signed an armistice agreement, implementing a ceasefire that stands to this day. De facto, the Korean War never ended.\nPublisher: ‎Pen & Sword Military (2020)\nPaperback: 128 pages\nISBN: 9781526778130\nAmazon Pen & Sword",

    "text": "Magazine articles\n\nAgainst the Red Tide Part 1: 27th British Commonwealth Brigade’s Korean War\n\nBritain at War Jun 2020\n\n\nOn June 25, 1950 the China and USSR-backed North Korean forces invaded South Korea, sparking a major conflict, the effects of which were felt around the world. The United Nations – including Britain and many Commonwealth countries – rallied to support the Seoul government, sending men and equipment in an effort to turn the ‘red tide’. The war raged for three years and at least two-and-a-half million people lost their lives – the true figure, which will never be known, is certainly much higher.\nAround 2,000 British troops from the 1st Battalion, the Middlesex Regiment, and the 1st Battalion, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, sailed from Hong Kong for the 1,200- mile voyage across the South China Sea to the war on the Korean peninsula on August 25, 1950. It would take the aircraft carrier HMS Unicorn and the cruiser HMS Ceylon four days to reach the South Korean port city of Pusan.\nThe 1st Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (1/Argylls), commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Leslie Neilson, and the 1st Battalion Middlesex Regiment (1/ Middlesex), led by Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Man, had formed the re-activated 27th Infantry Brigade in 1948 under the leadership of Brigadier Basil Coad DSO and Bar. The unit was soon to be retitled the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade (British 27th), due to the addition of Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Indian units. On arrival in South Korea it was immediately moved to the front at Taegu where, on September 2, it was placed under command of the US 1st Cavalry Division.\nLieutenant General Walton Walker’s threadbare US Eighth Army had been shoved inexorably back by Kim Il-sung’s Korean People’s Army (KPA) to a fragile toehold on the extreme south-east tip of the Korean peninsula. Walker had directed a planned withdrawal to the east of the Naktong River to take a defensive stand on what became known as the Pusan Perimeter. By mid-September, 140,000 American and Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) troops held the line: five ROKA divisions in the northern 160-mile front from Taegu to P’ohang on the east coast and, dug in along the western perimeter, the American 1st Cavalry and 2nd, 24th and 25th infantry divisions, and the US 1st Provisional Marine and British 27th brigades.\nFollowing the high-risk but very successful amphibious landing at Inchon on the Korean west coast on September 15, 1950, the supreme commander of United Nations forces in Korea, General Douglas MacArthur, regarded Walker’s breakout from the Pusan enclave as integral to his master plan. Walker’s objective would be to link up with the US X Corps, which was firmly established on the Inchon beachhead, 180 air miles to the north of the now besieging North Korean army.\nBy September 20, US forces had taken and secured all designated objectives east of the Naktong, including Hill 303 to the north of Waegwan. The US 24th Division, comprising the 19th, 21st and 34th regiments, and also the British 27th, crossed the Naktong onto high ground, from where they awaited the signal to commence a westward attack on the Taegu- Kumchon Taejon-Seoul highway.\nOn October 9, Gen Walker ordered his Eighth Army to “strike out for Pyongyang without delay”. From the vicinity of Kaesong, at 9am, the US 1st Cavalry Division, commanded by Major General Hobart Gay, spearheaded US I Corps across the 38th Parallel – the border between North and South Korea – pushing north in the centre for Kumchon. The British 27th then crossed the border, passing through the US 1st Cavalry Division in the centre to push the advance onto Sariwon. After beating the US 24th Infantry Division to the city on October 18, the brigade left Sariwon to recommence the march on Pyongyang, striking out of the division’s left flank. Meanwhile 3/RAR, much to its displeasure, was ordered west. The Australians were to approach the North Korean capital along the coast.\nOn October 19 Chinese forces began to cross the Yalu, and from the 25th were directly involved in the conflict. In the first few days of November, the defeat of ROKA II Corps at the hands of the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army 38th Corps, north of Tokchon, had exposed the US I Corps’ right flank, forcing Brigadier Coad to fall back south of the Chongchon River. Replaced in reserve by the US 21st Regimental Combat Team, Coad had 3/RAR advance to re-establish the river beachhead. The 1/Argylls moved next, followed by two companies of 1/ Middlesex, reoccupying hill features south of Tangdong and Pakchon. A period of tank-supported patrolling of the Pakchon area commenced to ensure the line of communication south, toward the Chongchon, was kept clear. Logistics had become a major problem.\nThe situation deteriorated considerably in the first week of December, forcing the British 27th to withdraw across the Taedong and Pyongyang. It met up with the recently arrived British 29th (Independent) Brigade. Continuing to retire south, on December 8 the 27th went into US IX Corps’ reserve at Sibyon-ni. Three days later, the brigade crossed back south of the 38th Parallel, arriving at Uijongbu where they remained in US IX Corps reserve. The 1/Argylls were tasked with protecting corps HQ but by this point the Chinese had broken off contact with the retreating UN forces in this sector.\nFollowing a relatively peaceful period patrolling and trying to stay warm, the British 27th was ordered to establish a position at the Han River on the southern reaches of the South Korean capital, Seoul. They would then cover the withdrawal of the US IX Corps.\n\n\n\n\nAgainst the Red Tide Part 2: 27th British Commonwealth Brigade’s Korean War\n\nBritain at War July 2020\n\n\nOn New Year’s Day 1951, the British 27th was deployed in defensive positions to the north of Uijongbu to cover the retreat of the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) 6th and US Army 24th divisions, hard hit by Chinese volunteer forces to the northeast. The brigade war diary described the sight of troops falling back and refugees in flight as “disheartening and pitiful”. On January 2, Uijongbu was abandoned and the brigade moved south, under command of the US Army’s 24th Division.\nThe next day, orders went out for Seoul to be abandoned, and the British 27th was tasked with providing the rearguard. From here, the brigade moved east to the right flank of the ROKA 6th Division. By the beginning of February, US IX Corps tactical HQ had withdrawn south to Changhowan-ni, where the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3/RAR) provided protection. Patrol duties were apportioned to the 1/Middlesex and 1/ Argylls, covering the top right and bottom left of the area respectively.\nOn March 6, now under command of the US 1st Cavalry Division, the British 27th pushed forward again, with troops from the 2/PPCLI and 3/ RAR spearheading the advance under heavy enemy mortar fire. At dusk the following day, the two battalions were short of their objectives, finding themselves on hillsides where they struggled to evacuate the wounded. Casualties were heavy – the brigade sustained 21 killed and 70 injured.\nOn March 25, after almost two weeks of inactivity, the British 27th was trucked north to relieve the US 19th RCT in the Hyon-ni–Kwanan ri area. The brigade continued with its relatively unopposed offensive, oblivious to the fact that the latest Chinese withdrawal had been deliberate and part of the communists’ strategy of cyclical phases of attack, withdraw and re-outfit.\nIn preparation of their spring offensive, the CPVA 63rd and 64th Corps had been building up their forces to the front and flanks of the 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment (1/Glosters). In one of the most celebrated battles in British military history, the Battle of the Imjin River, the Glosters effectively ceased to exist between April 22-25, 1951. Surrounded on Hill 235 and left to defend themselves against impossible odds and next to no resupply, the soon to be known as ‘Glorious Glosters’ suffered 580 casualties: 58 killed and a staggering 522 taken prisoner. A further 27 died in captivity.\nWith the collapse of the ROKA 6th Division during the night of April 22/23, the British 27th received rushed orders to block the gap to the north of the Kapyong River. The 2/PPCLI, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel James Stone, was to establish blocking positions covering the north and northeast brigade sector, centred on Hill 677.\nAt one minute after midnight on April 26, the title and command of the British 27th changed. Brigadier Brian Burke handed over to Brigadier George Taylor, commanding officer of the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade. Before departing for Hong Kong, Burke presented the brigade flag to Lieutenant-Colonel Ian Ferguson, CO 3/RAR, in recognition of their great comradeship and the high esteem felt throughout the whole brigade.\nThe British 27th, with support from ‘A’ Company, US 72nd Tank Battalion (on attachment from the US Eighth Army), had prevented superior numbers of Chinese forces from taking Kapyong, earning an American Presidential Unit citation “for extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of combat duties in action against the armed enemy near Kapyong, Korea, on April 24/25, 1951”.",

    "text": "Canada’s First Stand: Battle of Vimy Ridge\n\nBritain at War July 2021\n\n\n“Two minutes; one minute; thirty seconds; men gasped—perhaps a brief prayer. A mighty roar shook Douai Tunnel and all that trench world, and the stupendous, stunning barrage of 9 April crashed down before the Highland line. In a flicker of time the dawn was raving. A frantic shower of coloured lights sprayed up through the fog from the German line.”\nKim Beattie, chronicler of the 15th Battalion, 48th Highlanders (Toronto), 1st Canadian Division, dramatically portrays the seminal moment in this British dominion’s history which, in the words of author John Pierce, “came to symbolize Canada’s coming of age as a nation”. The battle was the first occasion when the four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF)—titled the Canadian Corps—fought together, and made a symbol of Canadian national achievement and sacrifice.\nAt the outbreak of the war, Canada was still 17 years away from being granted legislative independence by Britain, promulgated by the Statute of Westminster 1931. Therefore when Britain declared war, Canada found herself at war, even though ‘she had not been consulted; she had herself made no declaration of war’. But there was never any doubt that Canada would give her all, as reassuringly expressed by Governor General Field-Marshal H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, “that if unhappily war should ensue, the Canadian people will be united in a common resolve to put forth every effort and to make every sacrifice necessary to ensure the integrity and maintain the honour of our Empire.”\nHowever, the dominion faced a Herculean task as an ‘unmilitary nation’ with extremely limited resources and facilities to commit a fully trained and equipped expeditionary force for active service overseas. As of April 1914, the total authorized establishment of the permanent force was 3,110 all ranks. Supplementary to this there existed a ‘Non-Permanent Active Militia’ which, by 1913 stood at around 55,000.\nIn the Spring of 1917, the German Army High Command accepted the inevitability of a major French and British offensive, and to shorten the line, took the tactical decision to fall back from the Arras–Roye Soissons bulge onto the Siegfried Stellung—the Hindenburg Line. The total destruction of the zone they were vacating would be integral to the withdrawal. Early in March 1917, Lt Gen Sir Julian Byng, commander of the four-division Canadian Corps planned for a four-phase attack, each represented by a coloured line on the map. At an average distance of 750 yards from the Canadians’ front trenches, the Black Line, together with the enemy forward defences, would be the first objective. The Red Line ran north along the Zwischen Stellung from the divisional boundary with the 51st (Highland) Division to a point just south of Petit Vimy. From here, it swung northwest along the right flank of Hill 145 and Vimy Ridge, to the 24th (British) Division boundary.\nThis represented the final objective of the 3rd and 4th divisions attacking on Byng’s left flank. Onhis right, however, the 1st and 2nd divisions would still face two more objectives: the Blue and Brown lines. The first required capturing the village of Thélus, Hill 135, and the Bois de Bonval and Count’s woods, thereby securing a commanding position overlooking the village of Vimy. The second objective covered the German Second Line, running through Farbus Wood, the Bois de la Ville and part of the Bois de Bonval.\nBy midnight, Easter Sunday, April 8, 1917, along the whole Canadian Corps sector, thousands of troops of the four divisions, weighed down with combat equipment, moved forward to take up their respective jump-off positions in the forward trenches. Sleep had been impossible in the all-consuming pre-battle tension.\nZero hour and the Allied guns commenced a carefully stage-managed rolling barrage in front of the poised Canadians. Hundreds of Canadian Vickers and Lewis machine guns swept a zone 400 yards ahead, as the corps troops went over the top on the heels of the artillery barrage. They surged ahead against a thin rain with intermittent snowfall, focussing on the first objective, the Black Line the Germans called Zwölfer Weg.\nOnly threequarters of an hour after zero, the 1st and 2nd divisions had achieved the Black Line objective. The 3rd Division encountered only light resistance but the 4th Division faced the greatest difficulties—it would take them several hours to take their first objective. By 11 April, running for a length of 7,000 yards, and with a depth of 4,000 yards, the whole of the main part of Vimy Ridge was now securely held by the Canadian Corps. In the two days of fighting, the Canadians has suffered 2,967 killed and 4,740 wounded. At the end of war, the 1st and 2nd (Canadian) divisions formed part of the Allied occupation of force of Germany. The Canadian Corps was demobbed in 1919.\n\n\n\n\nShot at Dawn: Deserters in WWI\n\nBritain at War August 2021\n\n\nDesertion and punishment statistics emanating from World War One records also reflect inherent and divergent interpretations of military laws and codes. The Army Act of 1881, when flogging was abolished, the 1912 edition of the King’s Regulations and the 1914 Manual of Military Law formed the basis of British military law. However, it could never be envisaged that hitherto unknown prolonged static warfare of industrial proportions lay in the near future, which would leave military codes largely wanting.\nPresiding courts martial officers were often subjective in their understanding of what constituted desertion, and in the chambers of Westminster, the morality of shooting your own soldiers for desertion and cowardice polarised the political spectrum.\nIn April 1930, while hotly debating the issue of the death sentence as a punishment for desertion in the House of Commons, Secretary of State for War and Labour politician, Thomas Shaw, contended that the line between what constitutes cowardice and desertion was, at best, tenuous. Hansard, the official record of parliamentary proceedings, shows Shaw arguing that the two offences were “manifestations in different form of the same failure of nerve power or will power”, adding “if you allow the death penalty for desertion to remain you allow a penalty to remain which was responsible for no less than 92 per cent of the executions in the last War”.\nThe Army Council, however, countered the proposed abolishment of the death sentence—of which, ironically, Shaw was a member—by insisting ‘. . . dreadful and horrible as it is, it is a sanction which is essential to the discipline of the British Army’. Pro-capital punishment members of the House, however, believed there was a plausible ‘essential’ difference between the two crimes. Desertion took place “not in the heat, turmoil, and horror of the moment of battle, but probably somewhere behind the lines where the man at the moment of desertion is under peace conditions and safety, and he deserts to avoid the danger which he knows lies before him if he carries out the dangerous duty which he has been ordered to do”.\nThe inference, shared by the Secretary of State for War, but for different reasons, was that the overwhelming majority of desertion convictions were in fact cases of mental distress, commonly referred to as ‘cowardice’.\nHansard records Shaw as saying, “There is no romance in mud, vermin, and shell and shot, where men are destroyed without a possible chance of seeing the enemy they are fighting. There is no romance in that; it is simply brutality, dirt, disease and death. Where a man is engaged regularly in the Army you may be right in shooting him for cowardice, but you have not the same right in the case of civilian volunteers. You have no right to take a man from the factory or the farm and put him into khaki and a tin hat, and then shoot him if he shows cowardice”.\nFirst coined during the conflict by British psychologist Charles Myers, the term ‘shell shock’ was used to describe what would become known as post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. However, it would take decades of medical advances to fully understand the psychological and physiological trauma experienced by so many soldiers during the war—the so-called invisible wounds.\nVictims would present symptoms such as uncontrollable anxiety, facial tics, loss of sight, stomach cramps, hallucinations, and the inability to eat, sleep, walk or talk. Treatment varied considerably, depending on a medical practitioner’s diagnosis. In many cases, soldiers with shell shock were belittled as they were not ‘man’ enough to deal with the war. The imperative was to return the soldier to the frontline as quickly as possible. Others understood the cause to be as a result of a physical nerve injury, brought on by a soldier enduring prolonged heavy enemy bombardment.\nUsing full field court martial documentation for Private Arthur Briggs of the 9th Sherwood Foresters, I follow his trial, circumstances and execution by firing squad in France in July 1918. The descendants of Arthur Briggs—and those of all the other 305 men who suffered the same horrific end of life—had to wait 88 years for the powers that be to recognise that these executions were wrong.\nJanet Booth, granddaughter of Private Harry Farr, who was shot for cowardice in 1916, campaigned and lobbied tirelessly from 1992 until 2006, when Farr’s family eventually took the British Ministry of Defence to Court. They won their case, and under Section 359, ‘Pardons for servicemen executed for disciplinary offences: recognition as victims of First World War’, of the newly promulgated Armed Forces Act 2006, every one of these soldiers shot during the First World War was granted a pardon. The Act does, however, make it clear that the pardon only applies to the actual execution, and ‘. . . does not lift the convictions or sentences of the servicemen affected’.\nOnly a few years earlier, on July 24, 1998, the Minister for the Armed Forces, Dr John Reid, told the Commons, “There are deeply held feelings about the executions. Eighty years after those terrible events, we have tried to deal with a sensitive issue as fairly as possible for all those involved. In remembrance of those who died in the war, the poppy fields of Flanders became a symbol for the shattered innocence and the shattered lives of a lost generation. May those who were executed, with the many, many others who were victims of war, finally rest in peace.”",

    "text": "The Peacemaker General: Field Marshall Herbert Plumer\n\nBritain at War January 2021\n\n\nFifty years after the death of the plucky ‘Old Plum’, The Spectator lauded the civilian work in Palestine of the unassuming field marshal, Lord Plumer:\nA little old man, he had once commanded an army; now he only had his unarmed soldier-servant and such policemen as he might see fit to summon. During his proconsulship nothing happened, nothing we find worth recording in our history books. We do not remember his name in our churches, and in a few years it will be quite forgotten. But we prize peace more than war, and concord more than bloodshed, then let us praise God for that little man Plumer, Viscount of Messines and of Bilton in Yorkshire, during whose three years governorship Jews and Arabs performed in peace their lawful occupations. For it was he who gave them peace.\nBorn on March 13, 1857, in Kensington, London, Herbert Plumer was one of Britain’s most famous and esteemed soldiers. Educated at Eton, Plumer entered Sandhurst, graduating in 1876 with a commission in the 65th Regiment of Foot. His first overseas tour of duty was with his regiment in Lucknow, India, where he was appointed adjutant.\nIn 1881, the 65th and the 84th merged to form the 1st Battalion, the York and Lancaster Regiment, which arrived in the Sudan in February 1884 as part of the Nile Expedition, a British task force to relieve Major General Charles Gordon at Khartoum. He was promoted to major on January 22, 1893, posted to the 2nd Battalion, the York and Lancaster Regiment in South Africa, and appointed acting military secretary to the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Cape Colony, in December 1895. His fate to remain in the African sub-continent had been sealed, which was, for the 38-year-old, a fortuitous turning point in his military career.\nThe infamous and disastrous fiasco that was the Jameson Raid in January 1896, caused Britain unimaginable embarrassment. Within days, Plumer was sent to Mafeking and Bulawayo, in anticipation of a Transvaal Republic backlash. However, there was no immediate concern, and Plumer returned to the Cape in March. He had barely arrived, when he was sent to Matabeleland, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where the amaNdebele nation had come out in rebellion. Plumer raised a 750-strong Matabeleland Relief Force, and at the end of June 1896, Plumer marched on the Matopo Hills, the granite-bouldered stronghold and spiritual home of the amaNdebele. His campaign was a success, and in November, he returned to Cape Town, before making it back to England for Christmas, where he had become a household name.\nIn August 1899, Plumer was back in Bulawayo, this time to raise two mounted local regiments to protect the border with the northwest Transvaal from Boer invasion at the start of the Second Boer War. In the early months, Plumer, after several skirmishes, successfully prevented any meaningful Boer insurgencies across the Limpopo River into Rhodesia through his deployment of squadrons of the Rhodesia Regiment to the various drifts through the river.\nPlumer then headed south through Bechuanaland to the besieged Mafeking. At the end of March 1900, having overcome strong Boer resistance at Crocodile Pools, Plumer reached Mafeking. Colonel Bryan Mahon was approaching from the south with the other relief column, and the Mafeking siege finally ended.\nIn 1902 Plumer was promoted to major general, at 45, one of the youngest in the British army. Following a transfer to Ireland as GOC 5th Division, Plumer was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general in November 1908, and three years later he was appointed GOC Northern Command, Britain.\nIn 1915, Plumer was given command of V Corps withing the BEF Second Army, and in June he was promoted to full general and given command of the Second Army, which spent most of World War One around the Ypres Salient, including the famous battles at Messines and Passchendaele.\nFollowing the Armistice, in December 1918 Plumer was appointed GOC of occupying British forces in the defeated Germany, formalised in March 1919 as the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). Plumer established his headquarters in Cologne. On June 10, 1919, Plumer arrived in strife-torn Malta to take up his new appointment as British governor of this Mediterranean island-nation, and in August 1925 he accepted the post of High Commissioner to the British Mandate of Palestine.\nFrom the outset, the mandatory authority was drawn into the Arab/Zionist conflict, punctuated by armed clashes, labour unrest and Arab riots in 1920-21. Largely emulating his successful firm and well-informed modus operandi employed in Malta, Plumer regarded his role in Palestine as being apolitically administrative. During his tenure, Plumer went to great measures to improve the lot of Jew and Palestinian alike.\nIn August 1928, the ailing 72-year-old Plumer left Palestine, two years short of what should have been a five-year tenure. In the summer of 1920, Plumer had undergone a prostate operation, which doctors had indicated would improve his health over what it had been the previous ten years. The seemingly insurmountable task of attending to the conflicting needs of Arabs and Jews in equal measure had taken its toll. Ever loyal to the Crown, fulfilment of the divisive Balfour Declaration had remained the old soldier’s top priority. The following year, the King conferred the title of Viscount on Plumer, a reward for his work in Palestine.\nOn July 16, 1932, following another operation in the February, Field Marshal Viscount Herbert Plumer died in his home in London. King George V reflected a nation’s respect for one of its greatest generals:\n“My people throughout the Empire will, with me, mourn the loss of one whom history will ever gratefully remember not only as a distinguished commander in war, but as a great administrator.”\nA military procession, escorting Plumer’s coffin, wound its way along the crowd- lined route to Westminster Abbey on July 20. The Scotsman reported:\n“It is more than half a century since a military officer of high rank was buried in Westminster Abbey, and Lord Plumer is the first soldier to be interred there since the Unknown Warrior was laid to rest after the war. The Field Marshal’s tomb in the new Warriors’ Chapel is only a few yards away from the grave of the Unknown Warrior, on which this morning there lay a large cross of scarlet poppies”.\n\n\n\n\nAhead of Her Time: Lady Sarah Wilson\n\nBritain at War September 2021\n\n\nBorn on 4 July 1865 at Blenheim Palace, Lady Sarah Isabella Augusta Spencer-Churchill was the youngest daughter of the 7th Duke of Marlborough, and the aunt of Winston Churchill. Aristocrat, war correspondent, spy, adventurer and nurse, she was one of the first woman war correspondents in 1899, covering the Siege of Mafeking during the Second Boer War for the Daily Mail.\nIn 1891, in a lavish ceremony conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury and attended by the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII, Lady Sarah married Captain Gordon Chesney Wilson of the Royal Horse Guards, who became aide-de-camp (ADC) to Colonel Robert Baden-Powell at Mafeking.\nTypical of her class and late-Victorian society, Lady Sarah had a strong sense of civic responsibility, but she was condescending in her attitude toward the Boers, sharing anecdotes about their perceived ignorance that were intended to amuse. Society was, in effect, governed by men of the wealthy upper classes with political affiliation, men who advocated that women should be seen as sacrosanct, to be submissive ‘helpmeets’ in charge of motherhood and morality, but certainly not to take part in an active life outside of the Home”.\nHowever, it also came at a time when ‘corset-bound’ British women started to speak out about gender equality and the personal right to freedom from domesticity and access to explore opportunities beyond institutionalised sexualism. But in the Victorian society where ‘duty, character and chaste behaviour were of paramount importance’, the concept of the independent ‘New Woman’, complete with self-determination when it came to education, work, travel and feminist activism, was anathema to all but a tiny minority.\nHer first visit to southern Africa, in December 1895, coincided with Dr Leander Starr Jameson’s ill-conceived and disastrous filibuster raid into the Transvaal Boer Republic’s heartland to ‘liberate’ disenfranchised British citizens, the so-called Uitlanders, in booming Johannesburg. Lady Sarah described the event as, “No upheaval of Nature could have created greater amazement, combined with a good deal of admiration and some dismay.”\nIn the months leading to her brother Lord Randolph’s untimely death in January 1895, Lady Sarah had assumed control of his business affairs in southern Africa. This was a family development that fuelled the mutual hatred that existed between her and Lord Randolph’s elder son, Winston Churchill. In a clash of forceful and powerful personalities, Lady Sarah distrusted Winston, whom she held in low esteem, while Winston harboured extreme jealousy of her relationship with his father. To him she was a meddlesome mischief maker to whom he referred as “the cat”.\nWith the outbreak of the Second Boer War in September 1899 imminent, Lady Sarah accompanied her husband, Captain Gordon Wilson, to South Africa, but unlike the other officers’ wives who had made similar trips, she was adamant that she would not stagnate in Cape Town with the other socialites. That August Captain Wilson took the train north to Bulawayo to report for duty. Lady Sarah travelled with him. At Bulawayo she met Colonel Robert Baden-Powell who had been asked by the War Office to raise two mounted regiments to defend the Bechuanaland Protectorate (future Botswana) and the British South Africa Company-owned Rhodesia from Boer invasion. As chief scout to Imperial and locally raised forces during the 1896 Matabele Rebellion campaign, the future founder of the global Scout movement was deemed to have the right credentials to fulfil the brief. Baden-Powell, electing to base himself in Mafeking, took on Captain Wilson as his ADC.\nLady Sarah was required to remain in Bulawayo, but after a while she had enough of the ennui in Bulawayo, and caught a train south She alighted at Mafeking, ending her intended trip to the Cape.\nEarly in October, upon receiving word of an imminent Boer attack, Baden-Powell, who found Lady Sarah’s presence intolerable, ordered her to leave for Cape Town. However, excited at being so close to the opening shots of the war, she made a dash for Mosita, an African settlement 25 miles farther away from the border. From here she acted as a conduit for the dissemination of news about the Mafeking siege to the outside world. Carrier pigeons and a ‘trusty’ tribesman were used to clandestinely bring reports out of Mafeking. However, news spread of her activities, and early in December she was taken captive by the Boers on charges of espionage. She was held in Boer commander General Snyman’s laager, where he offered to swap Lady Sarah for a Boer horse thief languishing in a Mafeking jail. Baden-Powell rejected the offer, and an exacerbated Snyman threatened to send the troublesome English woman to the Boer seat of government in Pretoria where she could find a ‘pleasant ladies’ society’. The condescending sexist remark infuriated Lady Sarah, who stormed through the Boer headquarters and hospital, giving all in her way a barrage of insults.\nWith added pressure in Mafeking from Lord Edward Cecil, fourth son of Prime Minister Lord Salisbury, Baden-Powell relented, and Lady Sarah returned to Mafeking, after “two months of wanderings”, in exchange for Viljoen. Living in a bespoke underground bombproof bunker where she could entertain six for dinner, Lady Sarah dedicated much of her time to nursing the wounded and ill in the hospital. She readily adapted to a life filled with deprivation and constant danger from Boer shelling and attack. Her despatches for the Daily Mail were now more regular, informing the readership that, “The siege of Mafeking is no joke. Death is ever-present with us, a stern reality.” The siege was lifted with the arrival of a 2,000-strong flying column on 17 May 1900.\nLady Sarah Wilson died in London on 22 October 1929, aged 64. Not known as an outspoken advocate or champion of feminism or emancipation of the Victorian woman, she was fiercely independently minded. She made the most of her privileged situation in life to quench her insatiable thirst for personal adventure. She was not one of the exceptional female Victorian humanitarians who defied the male military establishment in South Africa, but for a married woman to enter a war zone entirely on her own went against everything deemed as proper for the time. She was way ahead of her time.",
