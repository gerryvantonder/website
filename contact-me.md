Thank you for visiting my website. You may wish to contact me for various reasons for which you can use my personal email address (**g.van-tonder@sky.com**). As this is a new website, and therefore work in progress, I would welcome feedback. Perhaps you would like to know more about a particular subject or individual, or enquire about specific research you may wish me to undertake. For the writer — budding and veteran — you may be looking for some assistance as detailed in my [Professional Services](services.md) section. Allied to this, let me know if you would like me to review and promote your book on my website.
