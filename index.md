Since coming to the UK in 1999, I have conducted extensive research and image
sourcing for the contract production of more than twenty non-fiction titles for Pen and Sword
Military Books (UK), Amberley Publishing (UK) and 30 Degrees Publishing (South Africa).
I have also self-published a couple of books. As an adjunct to book writing, I am a regular
feature-article writer for two UK military history magazines from the Key Publishing stable:
Britain at War and Classic Military Vehicle. (see [Publications](publications.md))

As a spin-off of my writing, I have conducted scores of paid research projects across
the globe on behalf of historians, authors, investigative researchers, military associations,

and custodians of rolls of honour and memorials, e.g. the Commonwealth War Graves
Commission and Bomber Command, UK. I also compile ‘Fact Files’ on behalf of persons
who wish to know what a relative did during either of the two world wars. In most cases, this
will include the sourcing of actual service records. I have assisted individuals trying to
acquire British citizenship by tracing a father or grandfather’s British service records. If there
is something you would like me to research for you, just drop me a line to chat about it and to
get a quote. (see [Professional Services](services.md))

Over the years I have conducted numerous proofreading and copy-editing
commissions from publishers. I continue with providing such services to any interested
parties, be they individuals or publishing companies. (see [Professional Services](services.md))

Finally, I would like to offer my website as a place where your book can be promoted.
I will need a high-res image of the book cover and a 100-word blurb on the book. I reserve
the right to decide on what is inserted. All that it will cost you is a copy of your book for a
full review and for my library! (see [Book Reviews](book_reviews.md))

Enjoy your visit and please contact me if you have anything specific in mind. I have a
vast electronic and printed data base and an international network of contacts, so I will
endeavour to assist where I am able. (see [Contact Me](contact-me.md))
